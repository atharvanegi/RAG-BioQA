    "Bacterial gastroenteritis is a pathogenic bacterial disease that can lead to functional gastrointestinal disorders such as atopic bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and hepatitis B and C. The pathophysiology of functional GI disorders is largely based on the pathogenesis of the disease. Gastrointestinal disorders are characterized by atypical gastrointestinal symptoms, which include irritability, bloating, and constipation. This is due to the presence of a bacterial bacterium in the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause a variety of gastrointestinal conditions, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) deficiency, apoptosis, irritable bowel, and dyspepsia. These conditions are associated with the development of bacterial gastroenterotrophic oesophageal reflux disease (IBS), which is the most common cause of bowel obstruction in the United States. This disease is also associated with a number of other gastrointestinal diseases, such as Crohn's disease, emphysema, ulcerative colitis",

    "Executive function may explain the association between IQ-mortality and IQ. It may also explain the relationship between cognitive reserve and executive function. The relationship between executive function and cognitive reserve may be related to cognitive reserve. The association between executive functioning and cognitive capacity may be associated with cognitive reserve or cognitive deficits. The effect of executive function on cognitive function may be a result of a combination of factors, such as age and premorbid IQ, that affect executive function in a population with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment. The influence of IQ on executive function may also be influenced by the influence of cognitive reserve on executive functioning in the population with low cognitive function.",

The prevalence of HIV in the U.S. is estimated to be about 1.3 million cases a year. The number of HIV-positive people living with the disease has declined significantly over the past decade, and the number of people who have contracted the virus has risen dramatically over the last decade. The spread of the disease is due to a number of factors, including a lack of access to adequate medical care, inadequate access to treatment, and a high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among young people. The increase in HIV prevalence is a result of a decrease in the availability of HIV vaccines and other preventative measures, such as the use of antiretroviral drugs, as well as a reduction in the number and frequency of HIV infections among young children and young adults. The HIV epidemic is endemic to many parts of the world, including Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and Africa.",

The results of this study are consistent with that of a previous study in which NOS inhibitors reduced VT and VE at rest and at increased carbon dioxide levels but did not alter the slope of the carbon dioxide response. These results suggest that adenosine receptors and protein kinase C are responsible for the protective mechanism seen with ischemia in a swine model.

The interarch and posterior tooth sizes may be related to the interaxial tooth size, which may be associated with a greater gap in an anterior tooth or a smaller gap between an anterior or posterior tooth, and the posterior tooth size. This can be attributed to the fact that the anterior teeth are larger than the posterior teeth, and that the posterior ones are smaller than the anterior ones.

    "Reduction of post-shift traffic injuries among gasoline station workers: are they related to the reduction of occupational gasoline vapor exposure? The following is a summary of the results of this study: The reduction of post shift traffic injuries is associated with a reduction in the concentration of a chemical that can be absorbed into the bloodstream of the gasoline station worker. The reduction in a gas vapor concentration may be related to a decrease in the amount of gasoline that is injected into the lungs of the gas station worker, which may be associated with an increase in the number of fatalities associated with the reduction in exposure to gasoline. The reduced concentration of gasoline in the blood stream may be a result of the reduced concentrations of the chemical in the gas stream, which can be an important factor in reducing the exposure of gas station workers to gasoline fumes. The results of the study are consistent with the findings of the previous study, which found that a significant reduction in post shift exposure was associated with reductions in the occurrence of fatal accidents resulting from the decrease in exposure of the aqueous gas stream to the vapor of gasoline. This finding is consistent with other studies that have shown that reducing a gasoline",

    "The radial forearm flap is a splint that is used to harvest a long bone stick from the forelimb. It is referred to as a bone stick. The length of the stick depends on the size of the bone stick and the type of bone it is harvested from. A bone stick can be harvested in a single day, and the length of a stick is determined by how long the stick is harvested. The most common method for harvesting a bony stick is to use a knife or a pair of scissors to cut the stick in half lengthwise. The blades of the knife should be sharp enough to cut through the stick without damaging the blades, but not so sharp that they can be easily removed by a medical professional. The knife blades should be able to be sharpened with a sharp blade, and should not be used to cut a piece of bone from a patient's body. The best way to harvest the stick would be to cut it in half, and then pull it out of the wound. The only way to do this is to shave the stick off of the skin, which can be a very difficult process.",

    "The prevalence of dementia in the United States has declined over the last decade, and the number of people living with dementia has declined in the past few years. The incidence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease in the U.S. is estimated to be at an all-time high, with an estimated prevalence of more than a third of all dementia cases in the US in the first decade of the 21st century, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH estimates that dementia is the leading cause of death among adults aged 65 and older, with a prevalence of 2.6 million deaths per 100,000 adults per year, a rate that is higher than the national average of 6.6 million deaths a year. The decline in dementia incidence has been attributed to a decrease in the prevalence of cognitive impairment in older adults, which in turn has led to the decline in the number and severity of dementia cases among adults over the past decade, as well as to an increase in the rate of dementia deaths among young adults. The number of cases of dementia has decreased in the last 20 years, and there is a continuing increase in dementia prevalence among older adults.",

This article is a review of the EMIT method for detecting CyA blood levels. The Emit method detects CyA in the blood of a person with a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) cell. This method can be used to detect CyA from a blood sample taken from the same patient as a normal blood sample. The liver function of the HSC cell is dependent on the amount of CyA that is present in the patient's blood. This means that if CyA is detected in a patient with an enlarged liver, it may not be able to be detected by the normal liver function. This is especially important if the patient has a severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis or hepatobilirubin deficiency, or if hepatitis C is present. This finding is particularly important for patients who have a high risk of developing liver failure. This article provides an overview of the different methods of detecting the presence of Cya in the",

    "The scale divisions on the proposed cervicograph form are in predefined relation to the accuracy of the measurements made. This enables improved portrayal of labour.",
    "While the operative time of laparoscopic repair for PS is less than in either of the open approaches, laparoscopic surgery may increase the risk for atypical injuries to the bowel. Therefore, proper attention should be paid to dissection of the structures and the selection of laparoscopic instruments. Incision on the superior umbilical fold is a reasonable alternative access for the treatment of PS.",
    "These results suggest that interplay of sex hormones and IL-10-819C/T polymorphism may lead to the susceptibility of gallstone-mediated gallbladder carcinogenesis.",
    "Concerning cerebral metabolism, long-term continuous insulin infusion appears to be safe as long as cerebral glucose levels do not fall below the physiological range. In view of the high incidence of hyperglycemia and need for insulin treatment, future studies on the effect of insulin on cerebral metabolism in SAH patients are desirable.",
    "There has been a marked decrease in community antibiotic prescribing linked to lower respiratory tract infection, tonsillitis, pharyngitis and otitis. Overall prescribing is now increasing again but is associated with non-specific upper respiratory tract infection diagnoses. General practitioners may be avoiding using diagnoses where formal guidance suggests antibiotic prescribing is not indicated. The new NICE guidance on upper respiratory tract infections is at risk of being ignored.",
    "Necessary further research should concentrate on silica exposures both above and below those that induce silicosis, so that the shape of the exposure-response relationship may be identified, with adjustments for likely confounding factors including silicosis. Time-dependent information on silicosis and on silica dust is required as well as the application of methods like G-estimation to answer the important public health question: Is silicosis a necessary condition for the elevation of silica-associated lung cancer risks?",
    "Older age appears to influence attitudes towards pain and analgesia. Factors such as poorer knowledge about taking analgesia, reluctance to communicate with medical staff, poorer performance status, and being more likely to live alone suggest that older patients may require greater support in the management of their cancer pain than younger patients. Targeted interventions are needed to test this proposition.",
    "Short stay (1 day) following open gastric bypass was a feasible and safe procedure. This approach might have economic impact and might increase patient acceptance for open RYGBP.",
    "These findings suggest that for a better understanding of the nondipping phenomenon, behavioral risk factors are important, and anger response styles may also be worthy of further study. Furthermore, anger coping preferences may be as important, or even more so, than levels of negative affect.",
    "Contact allergy to PPD was a more prevalent indicator for skin reactions to textiles than the TDM used in this study.",
    "No clear association was found between 1-year prevalence of hand eczema and smoking. Heavy smoking, more than 10 cigarettes per day, may give a slightly increased risk of hand eczema. Further studies with information on the amount of tobacco consumption and on possible confounders are needed to evaluate smoking as a risk factor for hand eczema.",
    "Within a population of short SGA children, prematurity is associated with a smaller size for gestational age and a shorter height corrected for TH and leaner phenotype in childhood. The response to GH treatment is similar for preterm and term short SGA children.",
    "In conclusion, AF on admission to the hospital with acute MI is associated with an increased risk of VF and subsequent mortality.",
    "Current smoking status appears to be associated with poorer treatment outcome after multidisciplinary pain facility treatment. Return to work within smokers is predicted by pain and worker compensation status. Pain facilities should target current smokers with significant perceived pain for close treatment monitoring in an attempt to improve treatment outcome.",
    "Sexual health programs targeting female college students, regardless of sexual orientation, must focus on behavioral risks associated with STDs. In addition, the importance of regular gynecologic exams should be emphasized, especially among lesbians. Further research is needed on risk-taking among female college students who are sexually active with both sexes.",
    "Patients with psoriasis had a skewed distribution of T lymphocytes, with an increased level of CCR7+ T lymphocytes compared to healthy controls. CD4+ CCR7+ T cells had abnormal expression, which might induce protraction and persistence of psoriasis.",
    "In this series, the indeterminate thyroid FNA category could have been reduced by diagnosis of samples with 4 or more of the studied criteria as definite follicular (50% of cases) or Hürthle cell (13.6% of cases) neoplasms and by more astute recognition of papillary carcinomas (14.0% of cases), which blend into this category, often as a result of less-than-optimal sampling or preservation.",
    "The START method is a simple technique used to triage quickly a large number of patients. Healthcare providers can undergo just-in-time training to learn this technique and use it effectively. The START colors also imply a correlation with the trauma ISS, with higher ISS more likely to be triaged \"red\" or \"black.\"",

    "The main effect of CAD acting as an arbitrator of discordant double-reading opinions is to increase the recall rate, significantly above what is found when arbitration is performed by an independent third reader. Using CAD as an arbitrator may be an option to deal with discordant double-reading opinions when no other method of consensus or arbitration is available.",
    "Decreasing the fluoroscopic pulse rate cannot be used as a method of decreasing radiation dose during performance of video fluoroscopic studies because it will potentially result in non-detection of episodes of supraglottic penetration of liquid barium.",

    "Decisions are insufficiently fair and legitimate. Effective mechanisms should be created for appeals, enforcement, and communication of complete rationales. Nonetheless, decisions and rationales are available, and criteria applied even-handedly. Such aspects are a benchmark for less adequate decision-making reported elsewhere.",
    "These results replicate previous findings that fatigue and depression are independently related to disability in those with CFS. A more complex statistical model, however, suggested that depression severity substantially influenced the strength of the relation between fatigue and disability levels across a range of domains, including complete mediation in areas involving psychosocial functioning. These results may aid in clarifying contemporary conceptualizations of CFS and provide guidance in the identification of appropriate treatment targets.",

    "This study demonstrates the added utility of integrating GIS technology into injury prevention research. Crucial information on the associated social and environmental influences of intentional injury patterns may be under-recognized if a spatial analysis is not also conducted. The join-count spatial autocorrelation is an ideal approach for investigating the interconnectedness of injury patterns that are rare and occur in only a small percentage of the population.",

    "A small number of patients may have normal neurologic status while harboring significant brain shift or brain herniation on cranial CT.",
    "UC involving the prostate and PA are present in most RCP specimens. UC can arise from extension of trigonal or bladder-neck tumours, proximal prostate ducts/urethra, or from cell implantation from manipulation of vesical neoplasms. The frequent high coincidence of prostate and bladder cancer can be explained by a common pathway of carcinogenesis.",
    "Informed decision making before initiating screening mammography is limited in this setting. There appears to be little indication that information about the benefits and harms decreases women's intentions to undergo screening. Methods to communicate information to women before initiating screening mammography are needed.",
    "These results suggest that SG with ABC and BBM in a clinical setting provides a bony implant site which permits implant placement and will tolerate functional loading.",
    "It appears that much of the genomic complexity of modern vertebrates is very ancient likely predating the origin of chordates or even the Bilaterian-Nonbilaterian divergence. The origin and evolution of vertebrates is partly accompanied by an increase in gene number. However, neither can we take this subtle increase in gene number as an only causative factor for evolution of phenotypic complexity in modern vertebrates nor we can take it as a reflection of polyplodization events early in their history.",
    "The study suggests that the fraction of febrile illness attributable to malaria is lower in HIV positive adults. HIV testing should be considered early in evaluation of patients with suspected malaria.",
    "The majority of impalpable PCs were low-volume, well-differentiated tumors corresponding to clinically insignificant neoplasms. Similar characteristics could be attributed to most of the impalpable carcinomas detected after prostatectomy in clinical practice.",
    "As in other VHL-related clear-cell tumors, there is a prominent capillary network immediately adjacent to the epithelium of SCA, confirming that the clear-cell- angiogenesis association is also valid for this tumor type. Molecules implicated in clear-cell tumorigenesis are also consistently expressed in SCA. This may have biologic and therapeutic implications, especially considering the rapidly evolving drugs against these pathways. More importantly, SCA may also serve as a model of clear-cell-associated angiogenesis and tumorigenesis, and the information gained from this tumor type may also be applicable to other clear-cell tumors.",
    "Hemodynamic variables cannot routinely substitute traditional variables as the burn shock resuscitation goal. Because of its noninvasiveness, ability to real-timely provide complete profile of hemodynamics, ED monitoring is a good adjunctive method for clinical judgment.",
    "RVR and absence of cirrhosis are the strongest predictive factors of SVR in HCV genotype 1 patients. Assessment of RVR is very useful in all pretreatment status patients in predicting SVR and provides information for individualizing therapy.",

    "With the increased bonded surface area, the mean microtensile bond strength of the resin cement to the feldspathic ceramic decreased.",
    "The diagnostic strategy for suspected leg DVT differs greatly among Italian centers. A relatively high rate of PE was recorded in patients with ICDVT for reasons which are open to debate. Prospective, well designed studies on the clinical risks and the need for diagnosing ICDVT, and the advantages/disadvantages of the two diagnostic procedures are urgently needed.",
    "Double curve patterns might be related to ESR1 gene rs2234693 (PvuII) site polymorphism. It is necessary to clarify the association between the polymorphisms of ESR1 gene and CALM1 gene and different subtypes of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in the further study.",
    "This report confirms the feasibility of unsedated colonoscopy performed by supervised trainees. The unsedated option minimizes direct and indirect costs of colonoscopy. Describing unsedated screening colonoscopy to patients as a \"sedation risk-free\" procedure encouraged them to consider the benefits. We recommend that future studies test primary care providers' willingness to inform patients of the feasibility of this nonstandard option, and perhaps reshape the practice of colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening.",
    "There may be some differences between hospital and population-based controls, which must be taken into account in the design of case-control studies. It is necessary to ascertain whether such differences are reproduced at other geographic locations and whether they can affect estimation of exposure-disease.",

    "Our procedure is useful for removing PVTT extending beyond the bifurcation or into other sectors that should be preserved in terms of liver function and enables a more conservative resection than an en bloc technique without sacrificing curability.",
    "RFS in patients receiving adjuvant CT was similar to that reported in the observation group and in historical cohorts without adjuvant CT. Thus, administration of streptozotocin-5-FU cannot be recommended in this indication.",
    "The self-report rate among cocaine- or methamphetamine-using patients presenting to the ED with chest pain was 51.8%. There seems to be no significant difference in the self-report rate among those who use methamphetamine vs. those who use cocaine, nor by gender, nor stratified by age over 50 years.",

    "Patients with anterior conduits had an increased risk of UTI and bladder stone formation compared to those with posterior conduits, although this was not significant in the case of bladder stone rate. This may indicate sub-optimal bladder drainage and should be addressed with careful preoperative counseling and close follow-up.",
    "The ipsilateral pedicle TRAM flap appears as safe as the contralateral technique for breast reconstruction. Given the increased pedicle length and preservation of both the medial inframammary fold and xiphoid subunit, we believe that the ipsilateral technique is preferred over the contralateral rotation.",
    "This study demonstrates that in a rat model, even direct intraneural injection of PC causes no damage. This information should encourage people to consider broader applications of PC.",
    "This study found JPS to be significantly reduced following a fatiguing task. But this change was only true for the end of range position, with JPS in the mid range not changing. If the mechanoreceptors are unable to accurately report shoulder position in the outer range (stretch) position due to repetitive tackling, then there is a potential for the anterior structures to become stressed before any compensatory muscle contraction can take place. These results highlight the presence of sensorimotor system deficits following repeated tackling. These deficits are proposed to contribute to overuse injuries and micro-instability of the glenohumeral joint which may be related to the increasing rate of shoulder injuries in rugby.",
    "It is possible to incorporate PET and/or PET/CT acquired in diagnostic positions into the treatment-planning process through the use of advanced image registration algorithms, but precautions must be taken, particularly when delineating tumor volumes in the neck. Acquisition of PET/CT in the treatment-planning position would be the ideal method to minimize registration errors.",
    "PEF after chemoembolization in patients with HCC was strongly correlated with large tumor size and was a significant independent predictor of overall survival.",
    "Measures related to the variability of the EMG pattern during rapid point-to-point movements provide neurophysiological measures that objectively distinguish PD subjects from healthy subjects. These measures also correlate with disease severity.",
    "Whether to use the European Society of Urological Oncology algorithm depends not only on its accuracy, but also on the relative clinical consequences of false-positive and false-negative results. Our threshold of 75 is an intermediate value that is difficult to interpret, given uncertainties about the benefit of seminal vesicle sparing and harm associated with untreated seminal vesicle invasion. We recommend more formal decision analysis to determine the clinical value of the European Society of Urological Oncology algorithm.",
    "Although MRCP is diagnostically useful in the perioperative management in some cases, its routine use in the DRG-era may not be justified due to the costs.",
    "Resuscitation of elderly patients in whom out-of-hospital cardiac arrest occurs is reasonable and appropriate, according to the findings of this study. Even though elderly patients are more likely than younger patients to die during hospitalization, the hospital stay of the elderly is not longer, the elderly do not have more residual neurologic impairments, and survival after hospital discharge is similar to that in younger patients.",
    "Serial LBP measurement may provide an effective and useful tool for evaluating the response to therapy in IE patients. We found a strong correlation between LBP and CRP concentrations; LBP has a tendency to increase earlier in cases of reinfection.",

    "These results support the concept that feeder-free conditions may partially contribute to hESC chromosomal changes but also confirm the hypothesis that regardless of the culture conditions, culture duration or splitting methods, some hESC lines are inherently more prone than others to karyotypic instability.",
    "From these findings we can conclude that part-time doctors are not aiming at efficiency by limiting the size of networks or by efficient reachability, because they want to contact their colleagues directly in order to prevent from communication errors. On the other hand, together with the growth of teams, we found this strategy, focussed on reaching all colleagues, was diminishing. And our data confirmed that formalisation was increasing together with the growth of teams.",
    "A wrong catheter position may adversely affect intravesical pressures; this finding has to be taken into consideration, especially when dealing with post-urological surgery catheterization.",
    "The remarkable heterogeneity in physicians' hand hygiene compliance among sites within the same institution is consistent with an important role of the local ward culture.",
    "The study produced a mixed result, with a high variation in travel patterns from school to school. Intervention research should address the complexity of multiple factors influencing student travel to school with a focus on changing local environments and parents' travel to work.",
    "Many pediatric inpatients had abnormal nutritional status or elevated BP. Systems to improve interpretation of these measures, which are commonly obtained in pediatric hospital settings, are needed.",
    "The MCQ and prediction equations proved inaccurate (excessive underestimation) in type 2 diabetic patients with hyperfiltration or normal renal function. With regard to CKD, the results obtained provided no evidence of superiority of the MCQ over the MDRD or the Cockcroft-Gault formula.",
    "Dog bites continue to be a public health problem affecting 1.5% of the US population annually. Although comparison with similar data from 1994 suggests that bite rates for children are decreasing, there still appears to be a need for effective prevention programs.",

    "The results show a high incidence of K/UT anomalies in children with SNN, and therefore K/UT should be investigated in this specific population.",
    "While seat belt use rates are increasing, many more lives could be saved by more complete restraint use. Effective strategies for increasing seat belt use rates and decreasing the number of both fatal and nonfatal motor vehicle injuries include primary enforcement laws, enhanced enforcement of seat belt use laws, and child safety-seat distribution combined with education programs.",

    "Many primary care physicians report low knowledge of CDHPs, limited readiness to advise patients on issues of cost and medical budgeting, and minimal trust in quality-of-care information.",
    "This study has shown a significant increase in awareness from using different kinds of media and has shown radio to be the most effective in our target community. Although the campaign has raised awareness, this study has not shown a change in health-seeking behaviour.",
    "There was a higher preponderance of UTI among male neonates. Its incidence peaked during the early post-circumcision period, as opposed to the age-related rise in females. UTI seems to occur more frequently after traditional circumcision than after physician-performed circumcision. We speculate that changes in the haemostasis technique or shortening the duration of the shaft wrapping might decrease the rate of infection after Jewish ritual circumcision.",
    "This study supports findings from animal studies of neuroplastic stress-related processes that occur in the hippocampus, amygdala, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulum during depressive episodes.",
    "The implemented restrictions may not be responsible for the observed reductions in firearms suicide. Data suggest that a change in social and cultural attitudes could have contributed to the shift in method preference.",
    "The results demonstrate that emergency physicians with less rescue experience rated the severity of illness or injury relatively lower in comparison to colleagues who had worked in the pre-hospital setting for many years.",
    "Understanding the factors that impact Latinas' mammography adherence may inform intervention strategies. Efforts to improve Latina's satisfaction with physicians by building trust may lead to increased use of necessary mammography.",
    "Isoflurane treatment showed no additional effects with RV on ICAM-1 expression, secretion of IL-6 and IL-8, and viral titer in A549 cells. These results suggest that isoflurane itself may not increase further RV infections, inflammations, and viral replication in patients with a viral URI.",
    "Pre-curarization with rocuronium 0.03 mg/kg affected men and women equally. Nor was the incidence and the severity of muscle weakness affected by gender.",
    "During our period of study, there was an increase in the utilization of evidenced-based drug therapies in people with diabetes and reductions in cardiovascular-related hospitalizations. Despite this, we observed no change in all-cause mortality.",
    "In the presence of a radial artery aneurysm an occupational and recreational trauma history should be sought after.",

    "Long-term follow-up after resection of cholangiocarcinoma is needed because late recurrence after 5 years occurs. The mortality rate between 5 and 10 years after resection of cholangiocarcinoma ranges from 6% to 43% in different series. Early detection of local recurrence may give an opportunity for further surgical resection.",

    "Staff in one UK ambulance service showed reasonable accuracy when predicting the likelihood of admission of patients they transport. They correctly identified most patients who would be able to leave. Further work is needed to support these findings and ensure that EMS staff safely triage patients to alternative destinations of care.",
    "A 50-g glucose challenge test may be used as a diagnostic test when the value is>or = 250 mg/dL. The present data suggested that the value of glucose screening of>or = 145 mg/dL can be used as a threshold for a positive test in the low risk women.",
    "Results suggest that physical activity during pregnancy is associated with lower risk for gestational diabetes among previously inactive women.",
    "Mothers with little education were consistently more likely to deliver by cesarean section than highly educated women, even when their partner's level of education was taken into account. Effective interventions aimed at reducing cesarean delivery rates in women of lower social class should be a priority for national health services, particularly in countries where the cesarean rate has been increasing.",

    "Transcranial ultrasound provides important information on prognosis in patients with acute stroke.",
    "The trend of NSS and ablative techniques stressed out the importance of pretreatment measurements of the distance between the tumor and the CS. This study as performed on radical nephrectomy specimens points out the overestimated proximity of the tumor to the CS. These data if confirmed by other studies, may play a role while planning the management of NS approaches.",
    "SPM is a rare entity that should be considered in patients with pleuritic chest pain. Treatment is supportive, and if no clues for esophageal rupture are present, investigations other than chest X-ray are probably not warranted.

    "The MUST score, but not the BNR, is able to predict increased mortality in older hospitalised patients.",
    "We consider that, these outcomes may emphasize the necessity to be careful when using negative expressions about stress relating to migraineurs. Further comprehensive studies are required considering the multiple triggers of the disease in various cultural contexts.",
    "We found a comparatively high prevalence rate of chlamydia-positive patients (11.4%) in our publicly funded pregnancy termination clinic. Because of infrequent follow-up in this patient population, we suggest screening and providing the epidemiologic treatment for CT genital infection for all women undergoing a same-day abortion procedure. It may prove cost-effective. Our prevalence rate of gonorrhea was lower (2.6%). The value of providing epidemiologic treatment for gonorrhea to all patients undergoing a same-day abortion procedure should be reexamined in controlled trials.",

    "Noncompaction of the left ventricular myocardium, by itself, does not seem to be a risk factor for stroke or embolic results, so there is no indication for oral anticoagulant therapy.",
    "This study shows that job resources are not only important for promoting work dedication, but may also moderate the negative impact of high job demands on the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. With respect to social support, the question is raised of whether this can also work negatively. The results of this study imply that, besides avoiding or reducing risks to health in the workplace and lowering job demands, strengthening job resources may additionally buffer harmful effects of job demands on musculoskeletal health.",
    "In this porcine model of septic shock early HVHF proved superior in preventing the development of septic hypotension. However, neither of haemofiltration doses was capable of reversing the progressive disturbances in microvascular, metabolic, endothelial and lung function, at least within the timeframe of the study and severity of the model.",

    "A rate of mammography screening based on a sequential sample can reasonably approximate the actual rate of mammography screening that would be found based on a full practice audit.",
    "High sense of coherence may influence antihypertensive medication-adherence behaviour. Aspects characterizing this psychological attribute, such as knowledge (comprehensibility), capacity (manageability), and motivation (meaningfulness) may be important determinants of adherence behaviour for asymptomatic illnesses, such as hypertension, in which patients often do not feel or perceive the immediate consequences of skipping medication doses.",

    "A significant proportion of PAPS patients displayed medium-high titre anti-NCS, suggesting that the autoimmune response against chromatin may be a relevant event not only in patients with SLE. Further studies are warranted to explore the predictive value of anti-NCS with respect to the evolution from PAPS to SLE.",
    "A circular heavy-weight polypropylene mesh seems to be appropriate for the application at the esophageal hiatus in terms of safety and stability. This means that it is characterized by a position-stable centered fixation around the esophagus without a tendency toward stenosis, migration, or erosion.",
    "The negative predictive value of sonography for palpable breast masses with probably benign morphology is high (99.4%). Therefore, short-term imaging follow-up can be an acceptable alternative to immediate biopsy, similar to the management of nonpalpable probably benign lesions (BI-RADS category 3).",

    "These data argue for further evaluation of PDX-1 as a biomarker for colorectal cancer.",
    "Our results suggest that aminophylline therapy does not add significant benefit to other standard therapies in hospitalized adult asthmatic patients. Because of the risks and cost of aminophylline treatment in the hospital setting, further research is needed to determine if there are subgroups of adult asthmatics who may benefit from the addition of aminophylline to other standard optimal therapies.",
    "Tight control of the maternal blood glucose concentration in the early weeks of pregnancy can be achieved by the prepregnancy clinic approach and is associated with a highly significant reduction in the risk of serious congenital abnormalities in the offspring. Hypoglycaemic episodes do not seem to lead to fetal malformation even when they occur during the period of organogenesis.",
    "Differences were apparent in the extent of avoidability of readmissions in different groups of admissions. However, assessors rated only 49.3% of the group with the highest proportion of avoidable admissions (surgical readmissions at 0-6 days) as avoidable. The remainder were thought to be unavoidable except for 2%, which could not be classified. The use of readmission rates as an outcome indicator of hospital inpatient care should be avoided.",
    "No CT characteristics, such as attenuation values, margins, and response to the contrast material, were found that would enable differentiation between isolated intraabdominal desmoids and those associated with Gardner's disease. Desmoid tumors associated with Gardner's syndrome tend to occur in the mesentery and abdominal wall, whereas isolated desmoids involve the retroperitoneum and pelvis. When studying CT scans obtained over time, new lesions were noted to develop in a few of the patients with Gardner's syndrome (three of 13), whereas no new lesions were found in patients with isolated desmoids.",
    "Our results show that CT findings cannot be used to determine reliably which patients require surgery and which patients can be treated conservatively. Even patients with splenic parenchymal injuries of CT grade III, IV, and V and with CT-based scores of 2.5 or higher can be successfully treated conservatively if the clinical situation is appropriate, whereas delayed splenic rupture can still develop in patients with low CT grades or scores. The choice between operative and nonoperative management of splenic trauma should be mainly based on clinical findings rather than CT findings.",
    "Although ventilatory depression preceded twitch depression, both occurred later with intramuscular mivacurium than would be expected after intravenous mivacurium or intramuscular succinylcholine. The authors speculate that the onset of intramuscular mivacurium is too slow to treat laryngospasm or to facilitate routine tracheal intubation in infants or children, despite administration of large doses.",

    "These data suggest a possible commonly shared pathogenesis between nuclear sclerotic cataract and age-related maculopathy.",
    "The data suggest a protective effect for AMD of high plasma values of alpha-tocopherol. An antioxidant index, composed of plasma ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, and beta-carotene, was also protective. The use of vitamin supplements to prevent AMD is not supported by these data, which showed no protective effect of vitamin use.",
    "The association of biomedical, socioeconomic, and psychosocial variables with high peritonitis rates has important implications for the selection of patients for CAPD in this setting.",
    "Some consensus on midwifery practice exists between physicians, nurses and midwives. In jurisdictions where opposition to midwives is strong, such consensus could serve as the starting point for the introduction of midwifery.",

    "Our results suggest that anger and, perhaps, aggression may be risk factors for cerebrovascular disease.",
    "The authors conclude that 5 mg bupivacaine is too high a dose in the elderly to limit the sensory blockade at T10 and avoid hypotension. In elderly patients, this dose allowed surgery to be performed, provided that the sensory level reached T10. When the initial dose only affects lumbar dermatomes, a caudal direction of the catheter must be evoked, and changing position must be preferred to incremental injections to reach thoracic levels.",
    "In a similar model to that in which it has previously been shown that glibenclamide prevents the effect of preconditioning in reducing myocardial infarct size (suggesting involvement of K+ATP channels), the most pronounced antiarrhythmic effects of preconditioning (reduction in ventricular fibrillation; increase in survival) were not modified by glibenclamide. This, and other evidence, suggests that the mechanisms of the protective effect of preconditioning in reducing the severity of arrhythmias and on infarct size are not the same.",
    "These findings argue for the poor repeatability of PSB in suspected IAP and question the yield of the 10(3) cfu/ml threshold. In attempting to diagnose IAP, the results of PSB must be interpreted with caution considering the intraindividual variability.",
    "The SMRs for stroke in those aged under 65 in these three health districts reflect the incidence of stroke. Case fatality at three weeks does not vary between these districts and consequently would not be a sensitive indicator of the quality of care. This also suggests that differences in services between the districts did not lead to changes in prognosis. In districts with high SMRs for stroke there is a need for further study and reduction of risk factors, thereby reducing the incidence and burden of stroke locally. This study provides a framework for assessing the needs for stroke prevention and treatment in both rural and urban areas without an elaborate protocol and detailed neurological assessment.",
    "It is suggested that constituents of the immune response (such as interleukin-1 beta) in major depression may contribute to HPA axis hyperfunction in that illness.",
    "WA1 is morphologically indistinguishable but antigenically and genotypically distinct from B. microti. Some patients elsewhere who were assumed to have been infected with B. microti may have been infected with WA1. Improved serodiagnostic and molecular techniques are needed for characterizing Babesia species and elucidating the epidemiology of babesiosis, an emergent zoonosis.",
    "Women are more likely to undergo screening with Pap smears and mammograms if they see female rather than male physicians, particularly if the physician is an internist or family practitioner.",
    "The one-on-one approach to health education in pregnancy usually used in the private setting may not facilitate addressing many topics believed to be important components of contemporary prenatal care. Providers of private prenatal care should initiate discussion of prenatal health education topics rather than relying on patient interest in requesting information. Just as public prenatal care programs have devoted significant resources to more comprehensive prenatal education, the providers in the private sector must assure that pregnant women receive the same comprehensive information. In so doing, these providers can help promote an optimal outcome for their patients, their patients' unborn children, and the family unit.",
    "The diagnosis of class A1 gestational diabetes is not significantly associated with obstetric and perinatal morbidities. A nondiscriminating diagnostic test undermines the validity of population screening for glucose intolerance.",
    "Women who terminate pregnancies for fetal anomalies experience grief as intense as those who experience spontaneous perinatal loss, and they may require similar clinical management. Diagnosis of a fetal anomaly and subsequent termination may be associated with psychological morbidity.",

    "These results indicate that additional symptomatic benefit can be attained by adding flosequinan to a therapeutic regimen already including a converting enzyme inhibitor. Because in the future most patients will fall into this category, flosequinan is a potential adjunctive agent in the management of severe congestive heart failure. However, because recent evidence indicates that the flosequinan dose studied in the present trial has an adverse effect on survival, the benefit-to-risk ratio must be assessed in individual patients.",
    "There is a dose-response effect of fish oil on blood pressure of -0.66/-0.35 mm Hg/g omega-3 fatty acids. The hypotensive effect may be strongest in hypertensive subjects and those with clinical atherosclerotic disease or hypercholesterolemia.",

    "In acute brain trauma with acute anemia, calculated arterio-jugular oxygen content difference and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption tend to be progressively lower, depending on the extent of anemia, which is in disagreement with coma scores. These changes in hemoglobin tend to have an inverse influence on cerebral consumption of oxygen, which, therefore, constitutes an alternative and independent measure of cerebral oxygen and independent measure of cerebral oxygen consumption under these limiting circumstances.",
    "The implementation of pulse oximetry in this manner gives an idea how effective the technology will be in reducing the use of arterial blood gas determinations without guidelines for the use of pulse oximetry. As only a marginal decrease was observed in the total population of medical and surgical patients, and only on the night shift, formal and standardized guidelines for the most efficient use of pulse oximetry should be considered. If these were considered, pulse oximetry may indeed make a significant contribution to improving the efficiency of care services.",
    "In this conscious animal model subjected to an LD50 IV cocaine insult, chlorpromazine and diazepam, previously shown to be of value in other animal models, had no effect on survival. Verapamil also did not affect outcome. Outcome was adversely affected by treatment with beta-blocking agents.",
    "Availability of cheaper cigarettes is not likely to be a cause of increased smoking initiation by adolescents. Although other influences cannot be ruled out, we suspect that the expanded tobacco marketing budget, with its increased emphasis on tactics that may be particularly pertinent to young people, affected adolescent initiation rates.",
    "Others have reported that MSAHs cannot compete with nonMSAHs in providing competitively priced care. The present study shows that for cholecystectomy, charges and length of hospital stay are comparable in MSAHs and nonMSAHs. This study supports the hypothesis that the leadership provided at United States medical schools may also extend to the area of cost-efficient care and hints at further areas of improvement.",
    "Although children and adults differ in regard to injury mechanism, their overall injury severity, associated injuries, and outcomes are quite similar. Thus, contrary to previous reports, children do not have a more favorable outcome after PC.",
    "Duplex surveillance of infrainguinal PTFE bypass grafts has a low yield and is inadequate at predicting continued bypass patency.",
    "Outcome differences in obese renal transplant patients were primarily due to a higher mortality resulting from cardiac events. Obesity seems to have little effect on immunologic events, long-term graft function, or cyclosporine delivery. Aggressive pretransplant screening for ischemic heart disease is essential to identify an especially high-risk subgroup of obese patients. Although it would seem prudent to recommend weight reduction<30 kg/m2 to all patients before transplant, these data suggest that obese patients with a history of cardiac disease should not be transplanted until weight reduction has been accomplished.",
    "For the visual assessment of fatty liver, spleen is not an accurate reference standard on contrast-enhanced CT. However, fatty liver can be diagnosed on contrast-enhanced CT if liver appears less attenuating than muscle-a situation that occurs only if fatty infiltration is pronounced.",
    "TUMT did not influence hormone levels. These observations suggest that androgen status may influence the final result of treatment.",
    "At a significantly high dosage, zinc can prevent loss of superficial keratocytes to a greater extent than culture medium alone can. Moreover, zinc has the advantage of preserving the most anterior layer of keratocytes. Retention of these cells may prevent the reactive overproliferation that constitutes haze after photorefractive surgery.",
    "In this sample, the number of hypothyroid symptoms reported was directly related to the level of TSH. The association was stronger when more symptoms were reported. Symptoms that had changed in the past year were more powerful than symptoms reported present at the time of testing. This suggests that traditional symptoms are valuable when deciding which patients to test for hypothyroidism.",
    "The analysis of the results suggests the need to improve the effectiveness of the PCCH as an instrument to achieve equality in individual care.",

    "A therapeutic end-point of normalization of an increased level of S-orosomucoid in addition to clinical remission may be difficult to use, as serum concentrations may be continuously increased in spite of clinical remission. However, this goal may still be relevant, as a trend towards higher risk of relapse was found in patients with increased orosomucoid concentrations after completing therapy.",
    "Corridor surgery for atrial fibrillation is a transient or palliative treatment instead of a definitive therapy for drug refractory atrial fibrillation. This observation strongly affects patient selection for this intervention and constitutes a word of caution for other, nonpharmacologic interventions for drug refractory atrial fibrillation.",

    "Pulse oximetry is a reliable method of diagnosis of aspiration in most dysphagic patients. However, careful interpretation of pulse oximetry data is necessary in older subjects, possibly those with chronic pulmonary disease, and smokers. The method is noninvasive, simple, and quick, and can be used routinely in the clinical assessment of dysphagic patients.",
    "(i) The presence of an intact local sensory innervation is a prerequisite to elicit pacing-induced preconditioning in the rat heart. (ii) A significant portion of cardiac basal NO content may be of neural origin. (iii) Release of NO and CGRP from capsaicin-sensitive nerves may be involved in the mechanism of pacing-induced preconditioning.",
    "Between 16% and 38.3% of the individuals treated are at high CR. If we also include patients with severe Hypercholesterolaemia and diabetics with Hypercholesterolaemia, this percentage rises to 59.7-73.3%, according to the CR assessment method used.",

    "Lipid peroxidation is increased in patients with diabetes mellitus and macrovascular disease and is not further elevated by the coexistence of elevated homocysteine levels. It is possible that diabetes maximally stimulates oxidative stress and any further acceleration of vascular disease in patients who have coexistent hyperhomocysteinemia is mediated through mechanisms other than lipid peroxidation.",

    "Pneumonia is an uncommon cause of infection in children with cancer hospitalized for fever and neutropenia. Therefore, the authors believe it is not necessary to obtain a chest radiograph in children with no respiratory abnormalities who are hospitalized for fever and neutropenia. [See editorial on pages 1009-10, this issue.]",
    "Patients with a stress defect at Tc-99m MIBI SPECT imaging should always undergo a resting SPECT study irrespective of the clinical and stress electrocardiographic findings. As patients without a previous myocardial infarction had a normal stress SPECT study in almost one-third (32%) of patients compared to only 4% in patients with a previously myocardial infarction, it may be useful to employ different referral and imaging strategies i.e., a stress-only versus a stress-rest procedure. To schedule referring patients differently according to the presence or absence of a previously sustained myocardial infarction may be cost-saving, less demanding for the nuclear medicine personnel, and patient-convenient. In addition, a stress-only imaging procedure reduces radiation exposure to the individual patient.",
    "The results of this preliminary study suggest that there may be less articular erosion at the left hand ring, and perhaps adjacent, MCP joints observed in ring wearers with RA. These data support the hypothesis that gold could pass from a gold ring through skin and local lymphatics 'downstream' to nearby MCP joint in sufficient quantities to delay articular erosion.",
    "The suggestion that some women have a natural predisposition towards having children of a particular gender is not supported by these data. On a population basis there is no evidence to suggest that gender determination is anything other than a chance process.",
    "Apatite-like deposits are frequently observed in the synovium of late stage osteoarthritis. Although not statistically significant, these results suggest a possible association between apatite-like and collagen deposits when the amount of apatite deposits is low. Further quantitative studies are recommended to investigate this observation.",
    "Review of axial source images provides limited benefit to interpretation of MR arteriograms of the distal lower extremity in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Although selective review of axial source images may be appropriate, axial images can improve interpretation when MIP images are complicated by the presence of patient motion, difficult anatomy, or artifacts. Axial image review may also be appropriate when a significant stenosis is identified on the MIP images.",
    "Tonsillectomy allows avoiding irradiation of normal larynx in 26% of patients who have a cervical lymph node with unknown primary. It should be performed in case of a single node of the subdigastric, midjugulocarotidian or submandibular area or bilateral subdigastric adenopathies.",
    "Weather may influence suicide in the elderly, probably interacting with biological and social variables. The rate of reported suicide appears to be positively related to fine weather conditions, during early summer, and not to extreme weather conditions as previously reported. Method of death appears to be also associated with weather conditions.",
    "The results suggest that continuity experiences in office practices are associated with preparation for the pace and types of visits that occur commonly in primary care practice, abilities which previous surveys of residency alumni and employers have found lacking. Some areas may benefit from a formal curriculum which may be implemented in the office practice, at the medical center, or at both sites. Preceptors may benefit from faculty development and continuing medical education that is directed not only at teaching skills but also at content areas which were not addressed in their own residencies.",

    "The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation is 2%. These data suggest that patients with advanced cirrhotic-stage primary sclerosing cholangitis are at increased risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma and should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma as well as for cholangiocarcinoma prior to orthotopic liver transplantation.",
    "New indications for partial splenectomy in other hematologic diseases makes the experience gained with Gaucher's disease valuable for management decisions.",
    "Although this study is not long enough to study the development of asthma, the results indicates that house dust mite avoidance measures had an effect on peak flow parameters and asthma symptoms in patients with allergy but without asthma. These findings might implicate that a shift in developing clinically manifest asthma could be achieved with house dust mite avoidance measures. To give a better answer to whether preventing the development of asthma is possible, larger studies with a longer follow-up period are necessary.",

    "Low incidence of MV>or = 15 days was observed (13% and 20%, respectively, in observational cohort study and validation study) in unselected SICU patients. LIS>or = 1 at the time of intubation provides excellent negative predictive value (0.93 and 0.91) of duration of MV>or = 15 days. These data suggest that tracheotomy should not be considered for patients with LIS<1.",
    "No improvement in survival was demonstrated with more advanced prehospital care.",
    "The majority of junior doctors misdiagnosed significant trauma abnormalities on x ray. Senior doctors scored well, but were not infallible. This suggests that junior doctors are not safe to work on their own in A&E departments. There are implications for training, supervision, and staffing in A&E departments, as well as a need for fail-safe mechanisms to ensure adequate patient care and to improve risk management.",

    "The presence of angina before acute myocardial infarction seems to confer protection against in-hospital outcomes in adults; this effect seemed to be less obvious in elderly patients. This study suggests that the protection afforded by angina in adult patients may involve the occurrence of ischemic preconditioning, which seems to be lost in senescent patients.",
    "The results support the theory that physicians often use endoscopic results to tailor medical therapy in patients with symptoms of GERD.",
    "The lack of a normal nocturnal fall in blood pressure is not associated with an increase in left ventricular mass or in arterial disease independently of age. Age-related changes in carotid artery wall thickness and plaque among nondippers may reflect a contribution of an altered baroreceptor function to the lack of normal nocturnal and supine blood pressure decreases.",

    "Normal regional differences in APD and the changes observed in hypertrophy are only partially explained by differences in I(tol). In hypertrophy, the normal endocardial/epicardial gradient in APD75 appears to be reversed. This may explain the T-wave inversion observed and will have implications for arrhythmogenesis.",
    "In patients at high risk for preterm labour, the presence of lactobacilli in the vagina does not seem to play a protective role.",
    "Because no significant variation in ACD was demonstrated, the prone and supine IOP variation could be due to something other than the change in lens position. However, a higher IOP in the prone position rather than in the supine position also suggests that it is not merely the episcleral venous pressure causing the IOP change. Investigation of the entire iris profile at different postures would be more informative in future studies.",
    "These results are in some contrast to the main hypotheses. As fulfilment of expectations was not associated with higher satisfaction, physicians need not necessarily worry that patients will change their doctor if he or she refuses a pharmacologically dubious prescription.",

    "In this large single-centre series of EPP for MPM, the implementation of induction IMRT was not associated with any significant increase in the surgical risks above and beyond induction CT. The switch from induction CT to induction IMRT was associated with resection in older patients with more advanced tumours, less transfusion requirements, comparable postoperative morbidity and 90-day mortality.",
    "This study demonstrates that the CPB machine can be safely omitted when a long-term VAD is implanted on VA-ECMO support. Blood loss in the first 24 h after surgery was less and a significantly lower number of blood products were necessary in these patients compared with patients in whom the CPB machine was used. However, similar survival rates between these two groups were observed.",

This study does not confirm previous observations reported in the Everest II randomized controlled trial indicating that, if the MitraClip therapy was initially successful, the results were sustained at 4 years. When compared with the surgical EE combined with annuloplasty, MitraClip therapy provides lower efficacy at 4 years.",

    "Vitamin D and calcium supplementation of orthopaedic trauma patients for 8 weeks after fracture seems to be cost effective. Supplementation may also reduce the number of subsequent fractures, enhance muscular strength, improve balance in the elderly, elevate mood leading to higher functional outcome scores, and diminish hospital tort liability by reducing the number of nonunions.",

The study outcomes (revealed high prevalence and seriousness of FI) emphasize the importance of close monitoring and appropriately managing FI in nursing home residents.",
    "There is an increased incidence of morbidity, mortality, readmission, and reoperation in OHNS surgical cases with resident participation, which appears related to increased comorbidity with AR patients. After controlling for other variables, resident participation was not associated with an increase in 30-day morbidity, mortality, readmission, or reoperation odds. These data suggest that OHNS resident participation in surgical cases is not associated with poorer short-term outcomes.",
    "We conclude that failure following MUS is associated with preoperatively lower MUCP, which can be used as a predictor of failure.",
    "Despite the predictably larger residual postoperative party wall following ESD, this technique produced statistically comparable swallowing outcomes. Given its low complication rate and comparable results, ESD should be considered first line therapy for medically high-risk patients with Zenker's diverticulum, while acknowledging a higher risk of symptom recurrence. ELD, with its slightly greater risk profile but low recurrence rate, is well suited for most in revision cases. OA may best be reserved for those patients in whom endoscopic approach is not feasible.",
    "MIP is equally effective as conventional PCNL in the treatment of large renal calculi. Both methods have a similar complication rate. The shorter operative time in PCNL may be based on the larger diameter and quicker retrieval of large fragments; the longer mean hospital stay may be caused by the handling of the nephrostomy tube. The current data suggest that the choice of the method mainly depends on the surgeon's preference.",
    "Distinguishing unit-level from individual-level variation in cohesion among military unit members reveals more varied associations with behavioral and mental health outcomes of deployment than have been reported in previous studies, in which these levels have been collapsed. Associations between individual-level variation in cohesion and mental health outcomes may result from pre-existing traits related to both perception of cohesion and risk for psychiatric disorders.",

Although 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were statistically higher compared with younger patients undergoing TAVR, the absolute and relative differences were clinically modest. TAVR also improves quality of life to the same degree in nonagenarians as in younger patients. These data support safety and efficacy of TAVR in select very elderly patients.",

    "Clinicians vary in their orientation of the tuning fork tines in relation to the EAC when performing the Rinne test. Placement of the tuning fork tines in parallel as opposed to perpendicular to the EAC results in a higher sound amplitude at the level of the tympanic membrane.",
    "More than 40% of knee arthroscopy patients qualify as obese. Although univariate analysis suggests that obesity is associated with increased postoperative complications within 30 days of surgery, BMI alone does not predict complications. Independent predictors of complications include patients with high ASA classification, dependent functional status, renal comorbidities, and a recent history of wound infection.",
    "The significant, albeit moderate, correlation between markers of compromised tissue perfusion on FLAIR and SWI suggests that these imaging features reflect different but interrelated aspects of cerebral hemodynamics during ischemic stroke. Our findings highlight that while HVS on FLAIR denotes the presence of leptomeningeal collaterals, hypointense vessels on SWI signify the sufficiency of cerebral blood flow at the tissue level and are therefore more critical in terms of prognosis.",
    "Nipple-sparing mastectomy is a safe and viable option for patients with a prior breast scar. Our results are comparable to the published data in patients without a prior scar. Caution should be exercised with patients who have a history of tobacco use or those requiring chemotherapy because these patients are at increased risk for infection and NAC/skin flap necrosis, respectively, when undergoing NSM in the setting of a prior breast scar.",
    "This is the largest study to date of trauma patients who received PBT and were transported from the scene by air medical transport. Our results show no effect of PBT on 24-hour and overall in-hospital mortality. Previous studies also suggest no benefit of PBT, which is counterintuitive to damage-control resuscitation. Prospective data on PBT are needed to assess risk, cost, and benefit.",

    "Compliance with Scottish prohibitions on display of tobacco products in small retail outlets was high immediately after the legislation implementation date. However, although tobacco branding is no longer visible in retail outlets, tobacco storage units with generic tobacco messages are still prominent. This points towards a need to monitor how the space vacated by tobacco products is utilised and to better understand how the continuing presence of tobacco storage units influences people's awareness and understanding of tobacco and smoking. Countries with existing POS bans and who are considering such bans should pay particular attention to regulations regarding the use of generic signage and where within the retail setting tobacco stocks can be stored.",
    "No significant trends or systematic errors were observed in the placement of seeds in PBSI, including seeds implanted directly into the seroma. Recorded seed displacements may be related to intrapatient setup adjustments. Despite observed seed displacements, acceptable postimplant dosimetry was achieved.",
    "We identified previously unreported VC underdosing in over two-thirds of our patients, with most of these patients having volumes of undistended VC that received less than half of the prescription dose. The maximum dimension was along the craniocaudal axis in some patients or left-right/anterior-posterior axis in others, suggesting that suture material may be restricting access to the vaginal apex and that alternative applicators may be needed when the diameter of the apex is larger than the introitus. Additional follow-up will be needed to determine whether underdosing is associated with isolated VC failure or whether low failure rates across the cohort suggest that some patients are being exposed to excessive dose and unnecessary risk of toxicity.",
    "Most patients undergoing THA sit in a similar range of pelvic tilt, with a small mean difference in pelvic tilt between patients with DDD spines and those without radiographic arthrosis. However, in general, the mechanism by which patients with DDD of the lumbar spine achieve sitting differs from those without spine arthrosis with less spine flexion and more femoroacetabular flexion.",
    "These findings show economic and clinical value of prophylactic stabilization of metastatic lesions when performed for patients with painful lesions compromising the structural integrity of long bones.

    "The roof of the acetabulum is the weightbearing portion of the acetabulum. It also maintains the stability of the hip. With precise preoperative planning of the resection and accurate execution of the procedure, the hip-sparing approach through partial acetabular resection can be performed in selected patients with malignant periacetabular neoplasms. Navigation makes it possible to minimize the amount of bone resection. In this preliminary report of a small number of patients, we had adequate short-term local tumor control. We believe the function is good, but we do not have a comparison group of patients to document improved function.",
    "Local-regional failure was seen most in patients who had gross disease at the time of IMRT, almost always occurred outside of the 70 Gy volume and was frequently in the area of oesophageal sparing.

Multi-period analysis is essential to accurately quantify the time profile of the value of implementation given the natural diffusion of the intervention and the incidence of the disease.",
    "Risk framing affects how respondents value the presented risk. Positive risk framing led to increased dominant decision-making behavior, whereas negative risk framing led to risk-seeking behavior. Attribute framing should have a prominent part in the expert and focus group interviews, and different types of framing should be used in the pilot version of DCEs as well as in actual DCEs to estimate the magnitude of the effect of choosing different types of framing.",

Dietary linoleic acid lowering should be further investigated as part of an integrative strategy for the prevention and management of idiopathic pain syndromes.",
    "This study adds to the literature on developing organizational improvement capability and has practical implications for health care leaders. Focusing on either projects or staff training in isolation has limited value. Organizations are more likely to achieve systemwide transformation of improvement capability if their strategy emphasizes developing or strengthening organizational systems, structures, or processes to support direct improvement efforts.",
    "Compared with 2003 and 2009, reporting rates for REC approval, ICP, reference to DoH, and study registration for clinical trials of anti-dementia drugs were enhanced in 2014 in the major medical journals of China. However, biomedical publications without definite statements of ethical considerations remain common, and this continues to be seen in Chinese journals. It is imperative that measures are taken to reinforce the ethical protection in clinical trials in China.",

    "(18)F-FET PET monitoring with static and dynamic evaluation is useful even in primarily (18)F-FET-negative glioma, providing a high detection rate of both tumor progression and malignant transformation, partly before further signs of progression in MRI. Hence, (18)F-FET uptake indicating malignant transformation might influence the patient management.",
    "Although pulmonary arteries in almost all sharing structures in the right upper lobes straddled anterior bronchi, those in mediastinal type and interlobar type in the left upper lobe were found to straddle the anterior and apicoposterior bronchi, respectively. These findings indicated that the interlobar type was speculated to be rotating mediastinal type backward in the embryonic period. This study strongly suggested a new concept that 'the lung segments never continuously exist from the early stage of the embryonic period as units, but they are only simple units artificially named by their prevailing bronchial branching patterns'. Therefore, during segmentectomy including lymphadenectomy for pulmonary tumours, the retrieval of the branching patters of pulmonary arteries could allow the segmentectomy to become more efficient with considering the formations of lung lobes.",

    "Early weight loss is consistently identified as a strong predictor of long-term weight loss. This could be because early weight loss identifies those more motivated and engaged individuals. Patients who have baseline factors predictive of long-term weight loss failure may benefit from additional support during the intervention. Additionally, if a patient does not achieve early weight loss, further support or transition to an alternate intervention where they may have increased success may be considered.",

    "Urodynamics status could not predict treatment outcomes between patients treated with tolterodine-ER or placebo. The results add support to evidence suggesting that urodynamic assessment is not a prerequisite for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). Therefore, we recommend that anticholinergic treatment may be initiated to patients with OAB symptoms without the need for urodynamics studies.",
    "Within the limitation of this study, respondents recommended that most symptomatic people present to their GP. However, we report no evidence that they recognised a cancer presentation, and duration of symptoms was not a significant variable in this regard. Cases that were identified as 'cancer' could not be classified as high risk on the available evidence.",
    "The prevalence of posterior crossbite is higher in mouth breathing children than in the general population. During mixed and permanent dentitions, anterior open bite and class II malocclusion were more likely to be present in mouth breathers. Although more children showed these malocclusions, most mouth breathing children evaluated in this study did not match the expected \"mouth breathing dental stereotype\". In this population of mouth breathing children, the obstructive size of adenoids or tonsils and the presence of rhinitis were not risk factors to the development of class II malocclusion, anterior open bite or posterior crossbite.",
    "This single-centre retrospective study supports the treatment for selected cases of anal canal cancer with smaller than standard radiation fields, avoiding prophylactic inguinal nodal irradiation. Hopefully this will translate into reduced acute and late toxicity. In future studies we would suggest that consideration is given as to whether omission of prophylactic inguinal nodal irradiation for early stage tumours should be explored.",

    "The type of probe significantly affects the overall prostate cancer detection rate, particularly in patients with prostate specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml and/or nonsaturation (8 to 19 cores) prostate biopsy. This may be because the end fire probe allows better mechanical sampling of the lateral and apical regions of the peripheral zone, where cancer is most likely to reside. We set the stage for a randomized, controlled trial to confirm our observations.",

We suggest that national qualifying level examinations should be considered in the UK.",
    "The results of this study indicate that despite perceptions of one university being 'better' than another based on public measures such as league tables, the students' perceptions of educational environment was quite similar and exam performance showed no differences. This suggests that the prestige or ranking of a university based on common measures and perceptions may have far less impact on student learning than careful design and delivery of the curriculum.",

Nebivolol by stimulating NO generation may have prevented protein oxidation. It could be speculated that ROS release, pro-inflammatory cytokines production and NF-kappa-B activation may play a key role. These positive changes could produce a favorable impact on exercise capacity in man.",
    "One-child mothers and young parents are at increased risk of RA later in life, possibly due to socioeconomic factors. The novel finding of a significantly increased risk of RA in women whose pregnancies were complicated by hyperemesis, gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia might reflect reduced immune adaptability to pregnancy in women disposed to RA or a role of fetal microchimerism in the aetiology of RA.",

The fact that rates were lowest in VRAs runs contrary to claims that increasing remoteness is associated with poorer health status. Despite the high death rate in RAs, there was a downward trend in mortality in RAs over the study period. This was partly attributable to a fall in the absolute number of deaths.",

The overall predictive performance of EuroSCORE is acceptable and most likely based on the presence of variables that are risk factors for both mortality and extended ICU stay. Hence, EuroSCORE is a useful predicting tool and provides both surgeons and intensivists with a good estimate of patient risk in terms of ICU stay.",

    "In term pregnancies, IAP values are significantly higher before delivery than in the post-partum period, where IAP values remain elevated for at least two hours at the level of postoperative classical abdominal surgery. The knowledge of these physiological changes in IAP values may help prevent organ dysfunction/failure when abdominal compartment syndrome occurs after cesarean delivery.",
    "Previous reports of less hyperopic mean spherical equivalent refractive error, and more myopia and less hyperopia in children of this age may be due to problems with achieving adequate cycloplegia in children with dark irises. Using up to 4 drops of 1% cyclopentolate may be necessary to accurately measure refractive error in paediatric studies of such children. Our results suggest that children from all ethnic groups may follow a similar pattern of early refractive development, with little myopia and a hyperopic mean spherical equivalent over +1.00 D up to the age of 5-6 years in most conditions.",

    "Treatment quality indicators measuring lipid- and albuminuria-lowering treatment status are valid quality measures, since they predict a lower risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with diabetes. The quality indicators for glucose-lowering treatment should only be used for restricted populations with elevated HbA1c levels. Intriguingly, the tested indicators for blood pressure-lowering treatment did not predict patient outcomes. These results question whether all treatment indicators are valid measures to judge quality of health care and its economics.",
    "While the overall AMI hospitalization and 30-day mortality rates significantly declined in women and men, hospitalization rates in women ≤55 years increased and their excess risk of 30-day mortality persisted.

Differential rotator cuff portals are needed to appreciate and treat posterior delamination. Patterns of delamination can be classified according to surgical repair strategy. It is important to recognize that the rotator cable may delaminate from the cuff and not to mistake it for a \"retracted\" articular layer, as previously described.",
    "Previous pelvic surgery does not seem to accelerate the onset of USI, as women without previous pelvic surgery presented at a significantly earlier age (53.2 years) with clinically bothersome USI than those who had previous surgery (62.4 years). Posterior colporrhaphy had the shortest interval to index USI surgery amongst previous operations.",
    "Our criteria should offer added value since they describe pathways in the process towards formulating integrated policy.

    "Obesity in our national sample of patients with MDE is associated with bipolar subtype and (hypo)manic symptoms. These findings suggest the possibility that the presence of obesity in patients with MDE might be related to bipolarity. A common impulsive-addictive diathesis is proposed as mediating mechanism. Further longitudinal studies in clinical and non-clinical populations are necessary to better define the burden and the role of the association between obesity and bipolarity.",

Further studies are needed to ascertain the precise point of view of patients, general practitioners and pharmacists concerning this issue.",
    "The use of RFA to treat patients with symptoms caused by saphenous reflux involves a small but definite risk of DVT. This study shows that the risk of post-RFA DVT is greater in patients with previous DVT, with a trend toward an increased risk in patients having treatment of the SSV. Periprocedural anticoagulation may be considered in this subset to reduce the risk of DVT after RFA. Thrombus protrusion without DVT was found to be more likely in patients with hypercoagulability, male sex, SSV treatment, and aspirin use. Additional prospective studies are required to analyze these and other factors that may predict thrombotic events after endovenous RFA.",

    "Changes in body composition over 3 years were small and comparable in COPD patients and control subjects. Nevertheless, muscle mass decline in underweight and fat mass increase in overweight/obese patients is associated with worsening health status. Overweight is associated with decreased mortality, but muscle mass and fat mass decline are detrimental for mortality.",
    "This study confirmed that the management and mortality of NSTEMIs in the public health sector in the Western Cape, South Africa is not influenced by geography, but rather by the level of service available in the hospital of first presentation.",
    "The amount of bleeding reported by women in early pregnancy relates well with VSE findings. Performing a VSE did not alter the subsequent management of these patients.

    "We have shown for the first time that the HH-OCT provides reliable measurements in children with and without nystagmus. This is important, as the HH-OCT will have a greater diagnostic and prognostic role in young children with nystagmus and other eye diseases in the future.",
    "Complex cases, such as PD, provide unparalleled learning opportunities and remain an important component of surgical training. We highlight the impact of resident involvement in complex abdominal operations, demonstrating for the first time that as residents build experience with PD, patient outcomes improve. This is consistent with volume-outcome relationships for attending physicians and high-volume hospitals. Maximizing resident repetitive exposure to complex procedures benefits both the patient and the trainee.",

    "The proportion of patients receiving reperfusion treatment was low, but higher in nLBBB, reflecting a partial adherence to the guidelines. We found no correlation between LBBB chronicity and MI. Furthermore, only a minority of the MIs occurred in patients with nLBBB. ST-concordance was found in only one of 36 MI cases, indicating lack of sensitivity for this test.",
    "The study suggests that social isolation and low societal participation are predictors of future disability pension. Social isolation and low societal participation increased particularly the risk of future disability pension in mental diagnoses among younger individuals.",
    "Approaches that aim to push improvement in patient safety through the involvement of patients could engender mistrust and create negative tensions in the patient-provider relationship. A more collaborative approach, that encourages patients and healthcare staff to work together, is needed. Future initiatives should aim to shift the current focus away from \"checking up\" on individual healthcare professionals to one that engages both parties in the common goal of enhancing safety.",

    "This study applies a new way of comparing different types of e-learning using a pre-defined level division and the possibility of peer learning. Our findings show that higher levels of e-learning does in fact provide better results when compared with the same type of e-learning at lower levels. While social interaction in web forums increase student satisfaction, learning ability does not seem to change. Both findings are relevant when designing new e-learning materials.",
    "Altered HRV, may be associated with the onset of CIP in ICU patients. Although not statistically significant (P=0.06), altered RMSSD may be a surrogate marker of CIP in ICU patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. The physiological pathway linking HRV and CIP remains uncertain.",
    "These findings suggest that the CBCL-DP is an effective indicator of psychopathological severity through its association with more comorbidities and more severe suicidality. Earlier detection of psychopathological severity through an initial screening tool could aid clinicians in planning treatment and providing quicker and more structured care based on the client's needs.",

    "Following OHCA and TH, arbitrary withdrawal of life support<48h after rewarming may prematurely terminate life in many patients with the potential for full neurological recovery. Additional clinical markers that correlate with late awakening are needed to better determine when withdrawal of support is appropriate in OHCA patients who remain comatose>48h after rewarming.",
    "These findings support the hypothesis that physicians are less likely than controls to develop or die of severe sepsis, implying that medical knowledge, higher disease awareness, and easier healthcare access in physicians may help reduce their risk of severe sepsis and associated mortality.",
    "Lumbar surgery in the WC system (particularly lumbar fusion) have the potential achieve positive outcomes that are comparable to CDOLD patients treated nonoperatively. This study suggests that surgeons have the opportunity to improve lumbar surgery outcomes in the WC system, even for complex fusion CDOLD patients with multiple prior operations, if they control postoperative opioid dependence and prevent an excessive length of disability. Through early referral of patients (who fail to respond to usual postoperative care) to interdisciplinary rehabilitation, the surgeon determining this continuum of care may accelerate recovery and achieve socioeconomic outcomes of relevance to the patient and WC jurisdiction through the combination of surgery and postoperative rehabilitation.",

    "These results suggest the establishment of a trypanosomiasis transmission cycle in the area. No salivary gland was found infected. Given that infected persons are regularly detected, we can think about the existence of a suburban sleeping sickness focus in Libreville. More analysis is needed concerning the identification of human trypanosomes and the origin of Glossina blood meals that may confirm the existence of that focus.",

The present study as well as the earlier contributions suggest that distinct cells activity, including platelets, may be identified in different types of urticaria.",
    "Although prediction of clinical likelihood varies between observers, endocarditis is generally found only in those individuals with a moderate to high pre-echocardiographic clinical likelihood. Strict adherence to indications for transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography may help to facilitate more accurate diagnosis within the moderate likelihood category. Patients with low likelihood do not derive additional diagnostic benefit with echocardiography although other factors such as physician reassurance may continue to drive diagnostic demand.",

    "The assumption that homes with fewer PUs and thus low PU prevalence according to the MDS PU quality indicator are providing better PU care was not supported in this sample. NHs that scored low on the MDS PU quality indicator did not provide significantly better care than NHs that scored high. All NHs could improve PU prevention, as evidenced by the poor performance on prevention care processes by low- and high-PU NHs. The MDS PU quality indicator is not a useful measure of the quality of PU care in NHs and can be misleading if not presented with an explanation of the meaning of the indicator.",
    "Bronchodilation by salbutamol was slightly more effective via Volumatic than via pMDI or Turbuhaler. No significant difference in bronchodilation was found between salbutamol via Volumatic and Diskus. The advantage of Volumatic is not of clinical relevance.",

    "This study found very modest changes in total diet, but no changes in serum lipids or body weight, associated with consumption of olestra-containing savory snacks. However, the low use of olestra by the study sample limited the ability of this study to detect significant effects.",
    "Although the global safety of infliximab in SpA is good compared with previous reports in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease, the occurrence of infections such as tuberculosis and retropharyngeal abscesses highlights the importance of careful screening and follow up. Focal nasopharyngeal infections and infection related symptoms, possibly induced by streptococci, occurred frequently, suggesting an impairment of specific host defence mechanisms in SpA.",

    "Retrorsine pretreatment did not affect sensitivity for carbon tetrachloride. A multilineage inflammatory infiltrate was observed in rats whether pretreated with retrorsine or not. Few donor cells co-expressing CD90 (THY 1) were present in recipient livers, which may resemble donor-derived hematopoietic progenitors or oval cells. No other donor cells within liver parenchyma were detected. This is in contrast to other cell infusion models of acute cell death.",

    "Strabismus surgery with adjustable sutures has a statistically significant better, final result than surgery without adjustable sutures. Patients' satisfaction and percentage change in angle of deviation is also much higher in the adjustable sutures group. As age, sex, number of previous surgeries, previous injections of botulinum toxin, and type and amount of deviation do not influence the final outcome, this type of surgery can be performed in virtually all types of patients.",

    "Overall, parental understanding of ED discharge instructions is good. However, there remains a considerable number (about 20%) who fail to fully comprehend the diagnosis or treatment directives. This subset might benefit from the use of lay terminology by the staff, institution of a special discharge nurse, or use of diagnosis-specific information sheets.",
    "Early identification of this microorganism is essential for appropriate treatment of endocarditis. Greater awareness and safe work practices can help reduce the risk of human infection by this microorganism.",

    "Changes in SpO2 do not reliably predict equivalent changes in SaO2 in the critically ill. Neither anaemia nor acidosis alters the relation between SpO2 and SaO2 to any clinically important extent.",
    "More attention needs to be paid to consent procedures if cold calling is to be defended on ethical grounds but it is unreasonable to expect this to be obtained at the beginning of a research study in a way that satisfies the requirements for informed consent. A suggested way forward is to obtain written consent for the research at the time that cold calling takes place before beginning the research.",

    "We found a gender-specific relationship between antidepressant use prior to first manic/hypomanic episode and rapid-cycling bipolar illness. When antidepressants are prescribed to depressed women who have a risk of bipolar disorder, the risk of inducing rapid cycling should be considered. Differing proportions of women and men in previous studies may account for conflicting results reported in the literature for the relationship of antidepressants and rapid cycling. However, this naturalistic trial was uncontrolled, and controlled research is required to confirm our findings.",

    "Metastases and local recurrence of malignant melanoma at the legs were found in 41% of women and 27% of men. However, a long scan does not yield relevant additional data. We found isolated new manifestations at the legs in only 1/153 patients. We recommend performing a long scan only in patients with previous melanoma manifestations restricted to the legs. In all other cases a short scan of the torso and proximal thighs is sufficient. This allows a higher number of PET-scans without loss of diagnostic power and a shorter examination time.",

    "Garlic intake for long durations (years) did not appear to have an effect on the prevalence of H.pylori infection. Garlic consuming subjects had a significantly lower average antibody titer than non garlic consuming groups, which might suggest an indirect inhibitory effect on the reproduction of H.pylori and possibly progression to more serious peptic ulcer diseases.",

    "As scrotal ultrasound gave false-negative results in 10% of cases and delayed surgery, we do not recommend this examination as an emergency investigation. Systematic surgical exploration of the scrotum in all cases of painful testis must be performed urgently without preoperative morphological assessment.",
    "Globular structures were noted in 22 (31%) of 71 cases of extravasation mucocele. They were present within cysts (11 samples) and in extraluminal connective tissue in the rest. They appeared to originate from alterations in connective tissue collagen following mucin extravasation. Their structure is different from that described in appendicial mucocele. When observed, they are best regarded as part of the normal sequence in the formation of oral cavity extravasation mucocele, without attaching special importance to them.",
    "Similarities between familial hemiplegic migraine and pseudomigraine with lymphocytic pleocytosis include recurrent headache with reversible neurologic deficit, cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytic pleocytosis, and triggers such as angiography. Even so, heteroduplex analysis and DNA sequencing failed to identify any sporadic mutations or shared polymorphisms in the exons or the intron/exon boundaries of the CACNA1A gene. These results do not support a role of the CACNA1A gene in the etiology of pseudomigraine with lymphocytic pleocytosis.",
    "The present study elucidates the variety of HLA associations and therefore the difficulty to assign single HLA markers to periodontal disease. Susceptibility/resistance of both aggressive and chronic periodontitis may rather be influenced by particular HLA marker combinations. Associated HLA haplotypes may be of further importance for unknown gene loci representing a part of the genetic background for periodontitis. The different associations in aggressive and chronic periodontitis indicate different susceptibility/resistance factors for both diseases.",

    "Only 70% of films had documented reports in the clinical notes despite this being a legal requirement. Radiology reporting does cause a direct change in patient management. Chest radiographs of patients admitted to a medical admissions unit should be reported by a radiologist with the minimum of delay.",
    "California's hospital system is far from being regionalized. Although academic hospitals appear better positioned than nonacademic hospitals, the vast majority of all hospitals do not meet Leapfrog's volume criteria. As efforts to use volume as a proxy measure of quality gain momentum, hospitals and physicians will be forced to measure and report quality. As such, surgeons need to decide between accepting volume as an adequate measure of quality and developing other possibly more direct and reliable methods.",
    "Young breast cancer patients have poorer outcomes, which are in part attributed to later stage disease, more aggressive tumors, and less favorable receptor status. There still appears to be other important factors, not included in our study, that are contributing to the worse outcomes for these young patients, such as socioeconomic status. Physicians need to have heightened awareness when evaluating this population, and increasingly efficacious adjuvant therapies need to be developed.",
    "For some questionnaires telephone administration may provide a convenient and cost-effective method of data collection. However, it should not be automatically assumed that all questionnaires will yield the same results regardless of the mode of administration used.",
    "In a group of patients with major and predominantly melancholic depression, differentiation according to gender was not important in treatment with common antidepressants. Women appeared to have higher plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants than men. The consequences of this difference for clinical effects are unclear. Gender-specific recommendations for dosing of tricyclic antidepressants may be considered.",
    "Ki-67 immunocytochemistry can be applied to liquid based cytology. The accuracy and diagnostic indices of the test are good when compared with those of other techniques. As part of a panel of screening procedures, it could be used as an adjunct to liquid based cytology to identify HSIL, and as a surrogate marker of HPV-16 infection.",
    "Although substance use disorder preceded the onset of schizophrenic illness in the majority, and increase in substance abuse preceded schizophrenic exacerbation in one-third of dual-diagnosis patients, overall there was no evidence that the course of substance use was associated with that of schizophrenia after both disorders were diagnosed.",
    "The usual check of the presence or absence of red clots in the dialyzer at the end of the dialysis session is enough, in the absence of red clots, to ensure that dialyzer efficiency is maintained during the whole treatment. Contrary to what is applied in CRRT, a continuous monitoring of DeltaP during intermittent hemodialysis would not significantly help to unmask unnoticed inefficient hemodialysis sessions.",
    "Most GPs apply ANAES guidelines and order plasma creatinine assays. However, there is a discrepancy between how the physician \"perceives\" the seriousness of the renal insufficiency and a more objective measure based on the CCR figure. It would seem that the CCR derivative is insufficiently exploited despite the widespread availability of converters. Thus, the PHENOMEN survey has revealed that the extent of renal involvement in patients with hypertension still tends to be underestimated by GPs despite the major implications of this complication in terms of therapeutic strategy and global cardiovascular risk.",

    "Required preclinical course work with family physicians was not consistently associated with greater student perception of faculty support for students' interest in family medicine, nor was it demonstrated to increase the amount or quality of interested students' interaction with family medicine faculty.",
    "We have demonstrated that severity of AVS does not correlate significantly with hypercholesterolaemia and CRP and their levels do not rise in accordance with increasing severity of AVS. Elevations of lipid levels in AVS were found to correlate with the presence of CAD rather than the severity of AVS. So, not in patients with simply AVS but in patients under higher cardiovascular risks, investigation of CRP plus lipid levels might provide benefit with respect to preventive treatment and benefit from cholesterol-lowering drugs can be expected in such kind of patients.",
    "The significant extra morbidity experienced in the first few months by all never-breastfed infants and at all times by HIV-infected infants who are not breastfed needs to be considered in all decisions by mothers, health workers and policy makers so as not to offset any gains achieved by decreasing HIV transmission through avoiding breastfeeding.",

The results of our study show that continuing efforts are needed to help women understand the risks and benefits of HRT.",
    "This study highlights the difficulty in defining SSI in colon and rectal surgery, which oftentimes is subjective and difficult to discern from the medical record. According to these preliminary data from our institution, there is poor reliability between clinical reviewers in defining SSI on the basis of the CDC criteria, which has serious implications. The interpretation of clinical trials may be jeopardized if we cannot define SSI accurately. Furthermore, according to current CDC definitions and infection tracking strategies, these data suggest that the institutional incidence of SSI may not be a reliable measure by which to compare institutions. Better methods for defining SSI should be implemented if these data are made publicly available and tied to performance measures.",
    "Rapid screening of young children (for rotavirus, adenovirus and norovirus) and symptomatic, elderly adults (for norovirus) during winter months may help to limit nosocomial spread.",
    "In our sample of MS patients we found a high prevalence of chronic pain, with those patients displaying a higher disability and a more severe depression. Moreover, FM frequency, significantly higher than that observed in the general population, was detected among the MS patients with chronic pain. FM occurrence was associated with a stronger impact on patients' QoL.",
    "There is widespread interest in using phone-based and email/Internet-based telehealth among patients with chronic diseases, regardless of their health status, access difficulties, age, or many other sociodemographic factors. This interest could be increased by helping patients gain confidence using technologies and through highlighting benefits and addressing concerns about telehealth. While the same pattern exists for social media telehealth, interest in using these technologies is minimal.",
    "The findings from this study demonstrate a potential correlation between routinely re-torquing halo pins and decreasing the incidence of pin replacement.",
    "Subtrochanteric fracture is rare following cannulated screw fixation of intracapsular neck of femur fracture (0.78%). In this retrospective consecutive case series, no subtrochanteric fractures occurred when the entry point of the lowest screw in the lateral femoral cortex is between the levels of the upper and lower borders of the lesser trochanter.",
    "Most drug use clusters were robust in their profile and stable in their prevalence, indicating little meaningful change at the population level from 2007. The targeting of alcohol and tobacco use remains a priority, but openness to experiencing diverse drug-related effects remains a significant concern for 12.5% of young people in this age group.",
    "The features of OSCC that vary at different ages are the anatomic predilection site and the association with classic risk factors. HPV was not an age-related independent risk factor for OSCC development in the present study.",
    "Alexithymia was not directly related to marital satisfaction. However, alexithymia appears to have a significant effect on relationship-related anxiety and avoidance. This association should be further studied in parents and their offspring in a longitudinal setting.",
    "From the results of our study, postoperative adjuvant CRT may be associated with longer 5-year OS and 5-year RFS in patients with D2 lymphadenectomy, but might not improve 5-year disease-free survival compared to non-CRT. Methodologically high-quality comparative studies are needed for further evaluation.",
    "Endothelial IDO expression is highly consistent in primary, sentinel and metastatic tissues of patients with melanoma, indicating that immune suppression in melanoma is determined very early in the disease course. This supports that IDO expression in melanoma is a marker of antitumour immune response with an independent prognostic value.",

    "Tumors presenting as an ill-defined mass or calcifications were more common in dense breasts. Spiculated appearance was related to invasiveness, and ill-defined mass to larger tumor size, regardless of mode of detection and breast density. The potential role of mammographic tumor features in clinical decision-making warrants further investigation.",
    "No association between the degree of TR and right ventricular volume or ejection fraction by CMR was identified. Failure to show worsening function or increased volume with greater degrees of TR suggests that the degree of regurgitation alone may not fully explain the heterogeneity in right ventricular size and function.",
    "The Dutch reimbursement policy with accompanying media attention was followed by an increase in quit attempts and quit success, but use of cessation treatment remained stable. The impact of the policy and media attention did not seem to have decreased or increased socioeconomic inequalities in quit attempts, use of cessation treatment, or quit success.",
    "Overall findings show no evidence that priming with lower difficulty malignant cases affects the detection of higher difficulty cancers; however, performance may decrease with priming.",
    "If the endoscopist is experienced in ERCP and precut techniques, an early precut strategy should be the preferred cannulation strategy because this approach is as safe and effective as the late fistulotomy approach and substantially reduces ERCP duration.",

    "According to evidence presented in this study, estimating compliance with standards of care for diabetes, ischaemic heart disease and heart failure from healthcare databases is likely to produce reliable results, even though completeness of data on diagnostic procedures should be assessed first. Performing studies comparing regions using such indicators as outcomes is a promising development with potential to improve quality governance in the Italian healthcare system.",
    "Children with high-activity genotype had higher initial FeNO levels and showed better response to therapy than children with low/intermediate-activity genotypes.",
    "Revision procedures can be avoided by screening programs. These should be strived for so that the neuro-orthopedic treatment on operation planning is not first initiated when pain occurs and revision procedures, such as angulation osteotomy or proximal femoral resection can be avoided. The reconstruction should also involve minimal deformation of the femoral head. In order to implement this, the interdisciplinary cooperation between neuropediatricians, social pediatriatricians and neuro-orthopedists should be intensified in the future.",
    "Individuals with patellar instability and previous patellar dislocation present with longer MPFL when compared to controls, and an associated IC less than 1.3 can be considered a predisposing factor for patellar dislocation. Treatment of patellar instability is a challenge, and it is difficult to identify what is the predisposing factor. This study has verified the measurements of the MPFL for the first time and presents values of thickness and length that can be considered as indications for surgical reconstruction.",
    "Increases in HbA1c from 1 to 5 years post-diagnosis were independently associated with increased odds of reporting a negative impact of diabetes on QoL. While our results suggest that efforts to reduce HbA1c do not adversely affect health-related QoL, large numbers of participants still report a negative impact of diabetes on their QoL 5 years post-diagnosis.",
    "It is hypothesized that the reason for limited N2 fixation in aquatic Utricularia, despite the large potential capacity, is the high concentration of NH4-N (2·0-4·3 mg L(-1)) in the trap fluid. Resulting from fast turnover of organic detritus, it probably inhibits N2 fixation in most of the microorganisms present. Nitrogen fixation is not expected to contribute significantly to N nutrition of aquatic carnivorous plants under their typical growth conditions; however, on an annual basis the plant-microbe system can supply nitrogen in the order of hundreds of mg m(-2) into the nutrient-limited littoral zone, where it may thus represent an important N source.",
    "Our study showed that the overcorrection group had non-statistically significant recurrence compared to the non-overcorrection group, and overcorrection more than valgus 15° has no benefit to prevent recurrence.",
    "We identified a diverse range of outcomes that have been used or are considered to be important. The development of a core outcome set would improve the design and reporting of studies and availability of data for evidence synthesis. Methods used to develop a core outcome set should be robust, transparent and reflect the views of all stakeholders.",
    "An antidiabetic role along with deleterious consequences for weight loss and liver function are possible in such circumstances. Such phenotype is broadly consistent with reported effects for the whole gut microbiome. Prospective controlled studies including molecular analysis of gastrointestinal fluid, and simultaneous profiling of the entire microbiome, are necessary to shed more light on these findings.",
    "Improvement in outcome scores after THA using the direct anterior approach was inferior in the presence of partial hip abductor tears. The repair of partial hip abductor tears was not associated with superior clinical results.",
    "Our data were at the lower range when compared with the available literature. Uncertainties in prognostication and the possibility of response to treatment can justify chemotherapy prescriptions in selected cases. We suggest that the focus should move to the provision of adequate and timely supportive care.",
    "In conclusion, there was no difference between smoking-related COPD and the control group according to TNF α-308 gene polymorphism in a Caucasian population. In addition, it was shown that important determinants of prognosis of COPD such as FEV1, BMI, COPD exacerbation and hospitalization were not associated with TNF-α-308 gene polymorphism.",
    "The findings of the present study suggest that BAC, diagnosed by mammography, is independently associated with C-IMT. C-IMT measurement is suggested as a useful tool to detect early atherosclerotic changes. However, haemodynamic variables (PSV, EDV, RI) were not statistically different between the BAC (+) and BAC (-) groups. Prospective larger cohort studies are needed to further elucidate whether BAC is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.",
    "There was good to excellent radiosurgical agreement in the assessment of the status of various middle ear structures. Improvement in radiosurgical agreement from existing studies in the literature was noted. This was especially true for features such as facial canal dehiscence. With technological advancements, CT temporal bone scans appear even more valuable for evaluation of patients prior to cholesteatoma surgery.",
    "Overall, limited functional differences were found between the two groups in this small pilot study, so a superior surgical technique could not be determined; whereas our limited sample size prevents a firm conclusion of no difference, our data can be considered hypothesis-generating for future, larger studies. Although some evidence indicated that patients with a bone bridge have improved loading at higher speeds, a regression of all patients walking at self-selected speed indicates that as residual limb length increases, loading increases regardless of amputation type. Thus, our data suggest it is important to preserve residual limb length to allow for improved loading in terminal stance.",
    "We find evidence of MH care quality improvement among cancer survivors between 2005 and 2010, a period that coincides with policy and clinical attention to psychosocial cancer care. These efforts may have reduced, but not eliminated, unmet need for MH services among cancer survivors.",
    "Expression levels of 4 biomarkers correlated with pCR after preCRT for rectal cancer. A scoring system based on levels of biomarker expression showed good sensitivity and negative predictive value for pCR.",

    "Our results demonstrated an independent effect of GDM on the risk of severe respiratory complications in late-preterm infants. Additional close monitoring and timely intervention are necessary in the management of these infants.",
    "Nail psoriasis is probably a suggestive feature of joint involvement. The scalp psoriasis, as well as intergluteal/perianal psoriatic lesions, is likely to be less associated to PsA, but may be an important comorbidity factor for the development of PsA. Further investigations in a larger population are encouraged to assess a potential link between PsA, site-specific and mild skin psoriasis.",
    "The results may suggest a lower adherence to photoprotection in male patients. Hyperkeratotic lesions recurred mostly at 6 months in comparison to non-hyperkeratotic lesions.",
    "The declaration to national poison centers of these intoxications should be pursued by emergency pediatricians, physicians, and pediatric intensivists. Family physicians can encourage parents to declare adverse effects to the National Consumer Product Safety Commission. Parents need to be better informed of the risk of laundry pods and strictly keep this type of product out of the reach of children. Given that it took 7 years after the first warning by the French poison centers to obtain safety recommendations for manufacturers, it is important to maintain pressure on companies to obtain the necessary modification of the physicochemical properties and child-resistant packaging.",
    "The results of the study proved the need for specific health education guidelines to conduct health education for low-educated employees. These guidelines should take in account the sources of health education preferred by LEEs as well as the factors that can encourage/discourage their participation in trainings concerning health.",
    "In our selected patient population, (131)I posttherapy scans are frequently positive in patients with elevated serum Tg levels, a negative diagnostic (131)I or (123)I scan, and a negative (124)I PET scan. Thus, for a patient with elevated serum Tg level, negative diagnostic (131)I planar scan, and a prior post-(131)I therapy scan that was positive, a negative (124)I PET scan will have a low predictive value for a negative post-(131)I therapy scan and should not be used to exclude the option of blind (131)I therapy.",
    "Significant hospital variation exists in cardiac surgical mortality and FTR rates after cardiac arrest. Institutional factors appear to confer the strongest influence on the likelihood for mortality after cardiac arrest compared with patient and operative factors. Identifying best practice patterns at the highest performing centers may serve to improve surgical outcomes after cardiac arrest and improve patient quality.",
    "BMP-7 may play anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic roles in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B infection.",
    "Patients want to maintain the traditional model of hospital based follow-up in specialist urology cancer clinics. However, this approach is not economically sustainable. If this is to change we need to work with our patients to develop a service that meets their needs. For a new approach to follow-up to meet the needs of patients, they need to be confident that they have access to expert advice and support, and are assured of referral back to the urology team if required. Nurses are ideally placed to play a key role in the development of such a service.",
    "The clock face continues to be commonly used in ACL reconstruction. Different clock-face definitions affect the position for the same \"time.\" When the clock-face parameters were strictly defined, there was good reliability with borderline accuracy and poor precision.",
    "Caution should be used when evaluating a failed ACL graft with MRI, especially in the absence of an acute mechanism of injury, as it may be unreliable and inconsistent.",
    "This analysis suggests that the effect of depression on mortality in persons with diabetes mellitus is most significant for older adults. Because there is evidence in the literature that treatment of depression in elderly adults can lead to lower mortality, these results may suggest that older adults with diabetes mellitus should be considered a high-priority population for depression screening and treatment.",
    "CyC measured 48 h after contrast media exposure may be a more sensitive indicator of CI-AKI relative to creatinine and Mehran risk scoring is in good correlation with CyC increase.",
    "A significant number of female patients had increased gluteal fat thickness beyond the reach of routinely used needles. The medications in these patients will thus be unintentionally injected to subcutaneous plane, possibly altering the pharmacokinetics.",
    "Both insecurity and inequality are associated with the geographical patterning of adult obesity rates across England.",
    "ASA occlusion is not commonly seen in CSM and CSA patients with SEA. Pathological changes about SEA in CSM and CSA have no close correlation with ASA occlusion, but may be with anterior radiculomedullary arteries.",
    "In obese adolescent patients with diabetes, a clear classification right from the beginning is not always possible. Characteristic findings of type 1 and type 2 diabetes may be present simultaneously. In the presented patient, monotherapy with metformin was sufficient in the first year. Close monitoring is essential to detect the transition to insulin dependence in time.",
    "Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy showed good procedural success rates in terms of cecal intubation rate and time, and a promising adenoma detection rate. Endocuff seems to improve endoscope tip control, especially during polypectomy. Endocuff may be a useful device for colorectal adenoma screening, and should be investigated in larger trials.",
    "We found no advantage or disadvantage in terms of EBL or operative time for early (≤48 hours) versus late (>48 hours) fixation for either PW or ABC/ACPHT acetabular fractures.",
    "There was no relationship found between first trimester NT measurements and complications that could develop in pregnancy. For the first time in the literature, NT and oligohydramnios were studied and no relationship was observed.",
    "The meta-analysis shows that the presence of an intra-abdominal drainage does not improve the post-operative outcome after pancreatic resection.",

    "Malagasy church leaders could potentially become key players in HIV/AIDS prevention if they improved their knowledge of the illness, their commitment to international recommendations, and extended their interaction with people most at risk.",
    "Sexual health is described by the World Health Organization as a basic human right. Clinicians may struggle to accept that adolescents with life-limiting illnesses may want to talk about sex, and this study has highlighted it as a topic that is generally ignored. Health professionals should include sexual health in routine palliative assessments. Adolescents with life-limiting illnesses should not be denied the right to holistic health care.",
    "Thyroid carcinoma is common in hyperthyroidism and thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy (TFNAB) is a reliable method in the diagnosis of the thyroid malignancy in these patients. We suggest that it is reasonable to evaluate nodules with TFNAB in hyperthyroid patients prior to surgical intervention.",
    "The RCRI did not predict cardiac morbidity in our patients undergoing major spine fusion surgery, despite being extensively validated in low-risk noncardiac surgical patients. Preoperative testing and optimization decisions, previously based on the RCRI, may need to be revised to include more frequent functional cardiac imaging and more aggressive implementation of pharmacologic modalities that may mitigate cardiac morbidity, similar to the preoperative evaluation for major vascular surgery.",
    "Anatomic ACL-R does not restore the native insertion site in its entirety. Percentage of reconstructed area serves as a rudimentary tool for evaluating the degree of native insertion site coverage using current individualized anatomic techniques and provides a starting point from which to evaluate the clinical significance of complete footprint restoration.",
    "The increased incidence of hair removal may lead to atypical patterns of pubic lice infestations or its complete eradication as the natural habitat of this parasite is destroyed.",
    "We confirmed the risk factor for post-dural puncture headache such as young age, and newly found that patients who underwent puncture at daytime developed more post-dural puncture headache than those who were performed puncture at nighttime.",
    "No significant difference in 25(OH) vitamin D level could be demonstrated between obese patients before bariatric surgery and obese patients with no obesity surgery project. No difference was found between our Parisian obese population and a Spanish obese population, which benefits from a better solar exposure. Both findings suggest that obesity itself is the link with vitamin D deficiency, independently from behavioral differences.",
    "Despite the frequent claim of a dependence of PM deficits from executive dysfunction, the reported cases demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case. The results are discussed in the light of current hypotheses relating PM impairment to other deficits that commonly occur as a result of damage to the prefrontal lobes.",
    "When diagnosing neglect, it is relevant to distinguish the type of region-specific neglect and, where needed, to adjust the rehabilitation program accordingly. As the CBS is not developed to typically measure ADL in extrapersonal neglect, it would be of importance to add other (instrumental) activities that heavily rely on processing information in farther space.",

    "In the specific case of lung cancer, cerebral staging in nonsymptomatic patients can be efficiently achieved with a minimalistic protocol consisting of a single CE 3D-GRE sequence, completed if positive with a T2* sequence for hemorrhagic assessment, thus halving appointment delays.",
    "Our results were somewhat conflicting: interviews did not reveal any prescription barriers, but quantitative methods showed regional differences, signs of underutilisation, and access inequality. Investigating use and accessibility, based on data triangulation, provides valuable feedback which can enhance evidence-based decision making for both physicians and policymakers. This could improve appropriate and efficient use and ensure equal access to expensive drugs.",
    "A large majority of respondents were not aware of PA guidelines and self-report knowledge of PA recommendations was largely inaccurate. Despite the role of PA in health promotion and in the management of rheumatic conditions, adherence to PA recommendations was low. Level of education, perceived benefits and barriers to exercise, and awareness and self-report knowledge of PA guidelines are associated with PA behaviour.",
    "Our results with FET in AADA show acceptable results. Total aortic arch replacement with an FET in AADA patients does demand high technical skills. In spite of this, we believe FET improves long-term outcomes in cases of AADA with intima tear or re-entry in the aortic arch or the descending aorta (DeBakey type I). Modern grafts with four side branches as well as sewing collars for the distal anastomosis have helped to further 'simplify' the FET implantation. However, such a strategy is not appropriate in all AADA cases; it should be implemented only in experienced centres and only if absolutely necessary.",
    "Implementing screening proved inefficient for recruiting distressed cancer patients post-treatment to a randomized controlled trial on PST, with need for services being much less than anticipated. Consecutively screening patients did not result in a sample representative of the larger pool of distressed patients, which may lower generalizability. An adequately powered intervention trial using screening requires a feasibility study establishing recruitment rates and dedicated, funded staff assistance.",
    "Although CRP is associated with hospital outcomes, this inflammatory marker does not increase the prognostic value of the GRACE score.",

    "Social deprivation does not influence weight loss after bariatric surgery, suggesting that all socioeconomic groups may equally benefit from surgical intervention. Social deprivation should not therefore negatively influence the decision for surgical intervention in these patients.",
    "Despite a significant comorbid fibromyalgia prevalence in a cohort of patients with CDOMDs entering an FRP, 41% of patients with an initial fibromyalgia diagnosis no longer met diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia at discharge and were indistinguishable from LO patients on pain, disability, and depression symptoms. However, both fibromyalgia groups (LFM and RFM) had lower work retention than LO patients 1 year later, suggesting that an FRP may suppress symptoms of fibromyalgia in a subset of patients, but prolonged fibromyalgia-related disability may be more difficult to overcome.",
    "Both numerical simulations for planning renal IRE and CT measurements may overestimate the size of ablation compared to histology, and ablation effects may be incomplete in the periphery.",
    "Microbial translocation is an important factor in gut immune activation and mucosa inflammation, as evidenced by the association between the dynamics of microbial translocation and activated T cells expressing the gut-homing β7 receptor. The recruitment of activated β7(+) T cells to the gut tract when alteration of microbial translocation is maximum may be the major mechanism for recovery of mucosal integrity.",
    "Total knee arthroplasty affects functional flexion axis only on frontal plane while has no effect on axial plane. Preoperative functional flexion axis is in a more varus position respect to the transepicondylar axis both in pre- and postoperative conditions. Moreover, the position of the functional axis on frontal plane in preoperative conditions is dependent on native limb alignment, while on axial plane is not dependent on the amount of preoperative varus deformity.",
    "Larger intact limb loading in individuals with traumatic transtibial loss were only noted early in the rehabilitation process, but these variables were present early and late in the rehabilitation process for those with transfemoral limb loss. Such evidence suggests an increased risk for early onset and progression of arthritis in the intact limb, especially in those with transfemoral limb loss.",

    "Posting a national unadjusted average hand hygiene compliance rate on a public website conceals the fact that most hospitals and medical staff are performing below the national hand hygiene compliance threshold. Given the poor compliance after 4 years of auditing to capture non-compliance, we must shift our focus to providing medical staff with immediate feedback and move to improving a single hand hygiene indication at a time, starting with before touching a patient.",

    "Multiple physical symptoms predict response to antidepressants, but not after adjustment for baseline depression severity. Physical symptoms could be a marker of severe depression rather than an independent prognostic factor and depression should be considered in patients with multiple physical symptoms. Treatment with reboxetine conferred no advantage over citalopram in those with physical symptoms, and it is less well tolerated.",
    "In the present study, which is the first investigation of proinflammatory and prothrombotic state, which is defined as a risk for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease, in bipolar disorder, ICAM and VCAM levels were found to be higher in first episode mania than those in subsequent remission and healthy individuals. As the study group included first episode mani cases, there was no effect of chronic psychotropic use. Probable risk of cardiovascular disease, reflected by increased ICAM and VCAM levels is already present in bipolar patients at the onset of the disease. In addition, ICAM and VCAM levels increasing in manic episode, return to normal in the subsequent remission period.",
    "The NRMP data from 1984 to 2011 supported our hypothesis that intercandidate competition intensity for orthopedic PGY1 positions has not increased over time. The misconception that orthopedics is becoming more competitive likely arises from the increased number of applications submitted per candidate and the resulting relative importance placed on objective criteria such as United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores when programs select interview cohorts.",
    "Septic arthritis after ACLR did not result in inferior objective knee function compared with uncomplicated ACLR. Subjectively, infection patients were as satisfied as non-infection patients, but rehabilitation took longer and fewer patients returned to sports. The findings of this study suggest that anterior cruciate ligament grafts may be retained with prompt, thorough arthroscopic lavage and debridement; correct antibiotics according to cultures; and repeated arthroscopy if necessary.",
    "MRI is better than mammography and better than ultrasonography for establishing the size of the tumor and for detecting additional lesions. Our results did not identify any subgroups in which the technique was more useful.",

    "This is the first study with the primary purpose to investigate growth of small AMLs (≤20 mm). Small, solitary AMLs (≤20 mm) do not require follow-up due to their low probability of growth. Patients with multiple AMLs and younger patients require closer monitoring due to their comparatively greater AML growth rate. Ultrasound-detected AMLs with an extra-renal component may require computed tomography (CT) to confirm their size.",

    "Among patients with active RA, ACR20 responses are highly specific measures of improvement as judged by patients, but exclude a substantial proportion of patients who consider themselves improved. Response criteria are associated with, but not equivalent to, patient-perceived improvement.",
    "The ICI-RS proposes that the terminology is slightly rephrased as: \"overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is characterized by urinary urgency, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, usually with increased daytime frequency and nocturia, if there is no proven infection or other obvious pathology.\" More substantive changes would require additional scientific evidence. Strengths, limitations, and practicalities of the definition of OAB were discussed at the ICIRS meeting 2013. Following a presentation of issues, the definition was subjected to expert discussion.",

    "In the current study we for the first time demonstrated that the capsaicin induced cardioprotective effect might be related to mild hypothermia, caused by capsaicin topical application. The salvage kinase pathway appears not to be critical for capsaicin-induced cardioprotection.",
    "Voucher schemes increased deliveries in health centres and, to a lesser extent, improved antenatal and postnatal care. However, schemes that targeted poorer women did not appear to be efficient since these women were more likely than less poor women to be encouraged to give birth in a public health-care facility, even with universal voucher schemes.",

Questions asking about proxies' views yield suboptimal agreement with patient responses. However, proxy scales of UI and fall concern are internally consistent and may provide valid independent information.",
    "In our randomized cohort of young patients with aortic valve stenoses, the Ross procedure was superior to the mechanical prostheses with regard to hemodynamic performance. However, this did not result in an accelerated left ventricular mass regression. Clinical advantages like reduced valve-related complications and lesser myocardial strain will have to be proven in the long term.",

    "The concern that incomplete excision of primary melanomas may result in an increased incidence of SLN micrometastases, artifactual or real, is unfounded. Similarly, there is no evidence that biopsy type adversely affects locoregional or distant recurrence. Although shave biopsy is generally discouraged because it may lead to inaccurate tumor thickness measurements, it does not appear to affect overall patient outcome.",
    "Although operative time was similar between the 2 groups, operative and total hospital charges were significantly higher in the laparoscopic group.

Furthermore, the improved hemodynamic performance of the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna compares favorably with both the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT and the Edwards Prima Plus.",
    "Compared with men, women undergoing CABG had a modestly increased LOS and a higher mortality. Total in-hospital cost was higher for women in each of the nine hospitals studied. Compared with other clinical variables, female sex is a relatively minor determinant of cost. Nevertheless, because of the expected increase in the number of women undergoing CABG in the future, this increased cost may translate into an important economic burden.",
    "The findings show equivalent postoperative outcomes after TEP and open repair of groin hernia in female patients. Because the wound scar after open repair is well concealed beneath the pubic hair and no superior clinical benefits are observed after TEP, open repair appears to be the technique of choice for the management of primary groin hernia in females. The TEP approach should be reserved for female patients with recurrent or multiple groin hernia.",
    "When trying to enhance the extent of OCB within a hospital, it is -- according to our results -- primarily essential to increase the job satisfaction of physicians as well as nurses. Within the nursing department, it is additionally recommended to enhance the employees' scope of action, if possible. However, for the enhancement of OCB it must be kept in mind -- according to our results -- that with rising OCB the stress (e. g. time pressure and interruptions) rise at the same time. The latter might result in higher strain for employees. In the group of physicians, on the other hand, a person-related approach seems promising: it is essential to reduce the physicians' subjectively felt strains as well as the job insecurity.",
    "Doxazosin significantly inhibited prostate (PC3) and bladder cancer (HT1376) cell growth. Furthermore, prior incubation of PC3 cells with 5HT or 5HT(1B) agonist increased cell viability as compared to treatment with doxazosin alone. These findings may be related to the similarity between subtype 1 serotonin and adrenergic receptors. The effect of alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists on tumour cell growth merits further investigation.",

    "In this first exploration of on-line mentalising abilities in schizophrenia, it is suggested that a failure to use appropriate mentalising language may be a trait marker for the disease. The nature of the type of tasks used to assess social cognitive processing in this group needs careful consideration, and tasks tapping into the fluidity of social interactions yield results that differ from previously reported studies.",

    "Although patients with HCV generally had higher rates of discontinuation due to TOXPC compared with patients without HCV, there was little evidence to suggest that this was associated with any specific nucleoside pair or third drug used as part of cART. Our results do not suggest that any specific component of cART is more poorly tolerated in patients with HCV or that the presence of HCV should influence the choice between antiretrovirals used as part of a cART regimen.",

The attachment dissuades only a small proportion of its female counterparts, which is promising considering the increasing role of female practitioners in the workforce.",
    "Reduced opportunity to use health services due to rural health and medical workforce shortages was the best-supported explanation for the lower rural complaint rate. Workforce shortages impact on the quality of rural health services and on residents' opportunities to improve their health status.",
    "Many of the differences are more easily explained by history and national values than by a robust base of evidence. There is a constant tension between a vision of education promoted by medical educators, based on contextually non-specific ideas such as those found in the medical education literature, and the sociopolitical foundations and forces that are unique to each country. If we fail to consider such variables, we are likely to encounter significant resistance when implementing reforms.",
    "Subjective SES is a better predictor of health status and decline in health status over time in middle-aged adults. These results are discussed in terms of three possible explanations: subjective SES is a more precise measure of social position, the results provide support for the hierarchy-health hypothesis, and the results could be an artifact of common method variance.",
    "Increased PFS associated with optimal surgery is limited to patients with less advanced disease, arguing for case selection rather than aggressive debulking in all patients irrespective of disease extent. Lymphadenectomy may have beneficial effects on PFS in optimally debulked patients.",
    "Transcatheter device occlusion has become an established treatment for ASD closure, achieving optimal results in older children and adults with anatomically suited ASD type II and PFO. However, a partial inferior sternotomy offers a valuable and complementary operative approach for all ASD variants, maintaining the predictable success of surgery, with the obvious advantages of minimal access in terms of morbidity, cosmetics and hospital stay.",

    "The strong association between SAS and morning onset of AMI found in this study could be the result of a sympathetic stress reaction to the breathing disorder.",
    "These data raise the issue of the appropriate screening for HB in children of FAP patients. To date, the efficiency of surveillance for HB is unclear. In Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), recent studies suggest an earlier detection of both Wilms tumor and HB by frequent screening. We discuss the rationale and implications of a screening program; besides the examination procedure itself, screening for HB in children of FAP patients would have important consequences for the policy of predictive testing in FAP. In a substantial fraction of sporadic HB, the disease is obviously the first manifestation of a de novo FAP. These patients should be identified by routine APC mutation screening and undergo colorectal surveillance thereafter.",
    "This study is one of the first to examine potential disparities in trauma and contributes to the small but growing literature in pediatric health disparities. Multiple explanations are explored, several with potential implications for reducing disparities in other health conditions. Identifying conditions in which evaluation and treatment appears to be free of disparities may provide insights for subsequent investigations and interventions.",
    "To have maximal impact on limiting epidemic spread of cholera, interventions should be targeted toward minimizing risk of transmission of the short-lived, hyperinfectious form of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae. The possibility of comparable hyperinfectious states in other major epidemic diseases also needs to be evaluated and, as appropriate, incorporated into models of disease prevention.",
    "Amniotic fluid glucose levels at the time of genetic amniocentesis are lower in women with spontaneous preterm delivery before 37 weeks compared to those who delivered at term. Amniotic fluid glucose levels of<or = 46 mg/dL at the time of genetic amniocentesis may be more sensitive, cheaper and have higher negative predictive value than C-reactive protein levels and white blood cell counts for the prediction of patients in spontaneous preterm labor. The greatest benefit of amniotic fluid glucose testing might be when the physician judges the patient to be at low risk for preterm delivery.",
    "Recommendations to use friendship as a basis for classroom grouping for cognitive tasks may facilitate performance of some pairings, but may also inhibit the performance of others. This is shown very clearly with regard to gender. Some of the difference in cognitive task performance may be explained by distinct, cultural (and social capital) orientations to friendship activities, with girls integrating school and educational considerations into friendship, and boys excluding school and educational considerations.",
    "Fallopian tube cancer is part of the BRCA mutation phenotype and seems to share many clinical features with sporadic fallopian tube cancers, including no exclusively proximal disease. The presentation of BRCA-associated fallopian tube cancers may, however, occur at a younger age and have an improved survival.",
    "Given that the data were cross sectional, firm conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the causal pathway connecting unemployment and smoking. However, this study suggests that psychosocial factors such as the inability to control and emotional isolation may be plausible mediators for the relationship.",
    "The high prevalence of unhealthy behaviours and risk factors for coronary disease in many immigrant groups might be a lifestyle remnant from their country of birth or might be brought about by a stressful migration and acculturation into a new social and cultural environment. Nevertheless, it is important in primary healthcare to be aware of a possible preventable increased risk of unhealthy behaviours and risk factors for coronary disease in some immigrants.",

    "Activated eosinophils in sclera or conjunctiva of patients with ocular limited WG may predict progression to complete WG.",
    "The duration of neutropenia is directly influenced by the aggressiveness of the chemotherapy regimen. In this retrospective study, we were able to identify a group of patients who needed two more additional days to recover from grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia, based on the degree of aggressiveness of the cytotoxic agents used.",
    "Differences between study populations hampered the comparability of the included studies. Although the majority of studies were underpowered, by using a meta-analytic approach we found an inverse association between birth weight and circulating cortisol level. Thus, our findings suggest that there is some evidence for a possible role of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in the epidemiological association between birth weight and cardiovascular disease. However, the strength of the overall association between birth weight and circulating cortisol level was weak.",
    "Of the 2 PWI parameters, CBFsq lesions most closely identifies, and MTTsq overestimates, final T2WI lesion volume. \"DWI/PWI mismatch\" does not identify lesion growth. Patients without \"DWI/PWI mismatch\" are equally likely to have lesion growth as those with mismatch and should not be excluded from acute stroke treatment.",
    "Outcome was not adversely affected by limb salvage, despite the presence of an insensate foot at the time of presentation. More than one-half of the patients who had presented with an insensate foot that was treated with limb reconstruction ultimately regained sensation at two years. Initial plantar sensation is not prognostic of long-term plantar sensory status or functional outcomes and should not be a component of a limb-salvage decision algorithm.",
    "Obese children have an increased rate of postoperative complications compared with children who are not obese. Therefore, parents of obese children should be warned that such children may have a potentially increased risk of complications associated with surgical management of a femoral fracture.",
    "Using an instruction video or palpation aid did not improve the effectiveness of breast examination in detecting tumors--a finding which supports results from large randomized studies. It is difficult to understand why BSE is still promoted by various groups.",
    "Consistent evidence of appropriateness of renal angiography in selected patients undergoing coronary angiography have been produced in literature. IMA and AOI angiography seem to be not justified unless they are part of SA in patients scheduled for arterial conduit with brachial differential pressure, thoracic irradiation or surgery, or of abdominal angiography to detect RA stenosis in laboratories with radiological digital peripheral equipment.",
    "Our data provide further evidence that early stabilization of combined thoracic and thoracic spine injuries is safe, does not alter perioperative lung function, and results in a reduced overall ICU stay.",
    "Occupational exposure to pigs greatly increases workers' risk of swine influenza virus infection. Swine workers should be included in pandemic surveillance and in antiviral and immunization strategies.",
    "This study suggests that females in mixed-sex schools have a tendency to have earlier exposure to smoking and alcohol consumption than girls of the same age in single-sex schools.",

    "General concordance can be considered low, although it is somewhat greater between the radiologist and the family doctor than between either of these and the expert. This poses the need to improve professional training in evaluation of the technical quality of images. In addition, there was unnecessary expense in large-size x-ray plates.",

    "Previous cesarean section is indeed a significant risk factor for damage to the lower urinary tract at the time of hysterectomy (odds ratio [OR] 2.04; 95%CI 1.2-3.5). When analyzed separately, the OR of incidental cystotomy at the time of TAH, TVH, and LAVH in a woman with a history of previous cesarean was 1.26, 3.00, and 7.50, respectively. Only the value for LAVH was statistically significant (P = .005; 95%CI 1.8-31.4).",
    "In the era of biologics and combination therapy, identifying remission or at least very low disease activity as the ultimate goal in RA therapy should become the new standard for the outcome of all RA trials. The criteria established by the FDA, the ACR, and the EULAR represent an important step toward achieving this goal.",
    "This retrospective study demonstrated that postinduction placement of caudal anesthesia does not affect PICU or hospital length of stay. A well-controlled prospective study is needed to confirm these findings.",
    "These findings suggest that in stable haemodialysis patients abnormal bone mineral metabolism was associated with increased soluble adhesion molecules. These alterations in adhesion molecules may favour the development of cardiovascular changes and contribute to high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with abnormal mineral metabolism.",
    "There was no evidence for a dominating role of steroid-resistant 'tropical glomerulopathies' in children with a NS in Ghana. Similar to South Africa, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and minimal change disease were the most frequent findings on histology. Contrary to Nigeria, membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis was not found in these patients. We conclude from this data and from the literature that the histological pattern of NS may vary between different African countries. Concerning therapy of NS under tropical conditions, we emphasize that despite the limited therapeutic facilities half of these patients may benefit from corticosteroids; however, steroid resistance and FSGS resulted in a high mortality.",
    "Abnormal findings on auscultation in patients with LRTI strongly predict antibiotic prescribing and this is probably inappropriate for most patients. These results should prompt GPs to consider the extent to which finding 'crackles/rhonchi on auscultation' influences their decisions to prescribe antibiotics for their patients with LRTI, and to consider the predictive value of individual clinical signs in reaching evidence-based prescribing decisions.",
    "Whereas specific 'free' interventions reduced social inequalities for the groups affected, for the total population health-inequalities were slightly amplified during the war. Once the population returned to their urban homes, mortality fell to pre-war levels even though some fighting continued, limited humanitarian aid was available and the pre-war infra-structure had not been re-established.",
    "Syphilis in pregnant women in Francistown has been decreasing for the last 6 years, despite extremely high HIV prevalence (stable at>or =40% since 1996) in the same population. Reasons contributing to the decline in syphilis rates may include nationwide implementation of syndromic management of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in 1992, improved access to health care, and less risky sexual behaviour. There is evidence from other sources indicating that risky sexual behaviour in Botswana has decreased during the HIV epidemic.",

    "In this study, the long-term outcome after laparoscopic ileocolic resection was not shown to be statistically different from that of open ileocolic resection. The relatively low recurrence rates in both groups may be explained by our aggressive use of chemoprophylaxis.",
    ": In this study, serum hyaluronan levels were significantly elevated in patients with constrictive fibrosis after breast augmentation, and there was a positive correlation with the stage of capsular contracture. Serum hyaluronan concentration may help in defining patients at risk for capsular fibrosis. If treatment with new drugs can be started as a preventive measure, it may be possible to reduce the rate of patients who require surgical intervention.",
    "As a result of this study, it was determined that last year students had improved attitudes toward the mentally ill; however, they still had striking stigmatizing opinions and judgments. The improvement in the attitude score between the second and the sixth graders is considered a result of the students' contact and interaction with persons having mental disorders throughout their medical education. The challenge is to maintain a social environment that aims to reduce the distance between the patient and the medical staff through introducing a holistic approach in medical schools.",

    "Lipoprotein(a), the variance of which is known to be overwhelmingly due to the apo(a) isoforms, proved to have a significant inverse independent association with a measure of abdominal obesity. Lipoprotein(a) levels appeared not to be associated with risk for MS or CHD among men. In women, however, high Lp(a) levels were accompanied with an environment less prone to MS, and - without attaining significance -- tended to be associated with CHD likelihood, independent of age and MS. Further studies are warranted in this area.",
    "Female patients with MS had both left ventricular DD and a global dysfunction with an increased MPI. The EF-2D and EF-T were not different significantly between patients and controls, but patients with MS had a relatively reduced EF-AVPD. The AVPD method may indicate a systolic dysfunction with a relatively lower AVPD-mean and relatively lower EF-AVPD. The presence of global dysfunction in patients with MS may lead to heart failure.",
    "Both affected and unaffected sisters had more set-shifting difficulties than unrelated healthy women. This finding, together with the replicated finding that set-shifting difficulties persist after recovery, suggests that set-shifting difficulties are trait characteristics and may inform the search for the endophenotype in anorexia nervosa.",

    "All three simulators demonstrated significant construct and reasonable face validity. Although virtual reality holds great promise to expand the scope of laparoscopic simulation, current interfaces may limit their utility for assessment. Computer-enhanced video trainers may offer an improved interface while incorporating useful multidimensional metrics. Further work is needed to establish standards for appropriate skills assessment methods and performance levels using simulators.",
    "Simple clinical and endoscopic findings predicted early-stage disease in 82% of cases, whereas a small but significant percentage had node metastasis. Because node metastasis predisposes to local failure in nonresectional treatment options such as endoscopic mucosal resection and photodynamic therapy, such findings should have a significant bearing on treatment decisions.",

    "Current measures of appropriateness of prescribing depend predominantly on pharmacological criteria, and so do not represent cases that would be judged appropriate when including the patient's views and contextual factors. If most prescribing is appropriate then use of these measures may lead to more false negatives than real negatives. The instruments should be renamed as measures of 'pharmacological appropriateness' and are useful where the incidence of this type of inappropriate prescribing is relatively high.",

    "Our findings raise policy concerns that MC may reduce the quality of care provided by public SAT facilities by limiting the range of services offered. On the other hand, we find that FP clinics increase their range of services. One explanation is that MC results in standardization of service offerings across facilities of different ownership type. Further research is needed to better understand both the specific mechanisms of MC on SAT and the net impact on society.",
    "The three clusters identified in our AN sample were similar to those previously identified in broader eating disordered samples. Personality-based clusters did not correspond overall to clinical symptoms but aetiological differences supported their validity. Broader personality pathology indicative of emotional dysregulation, problems with identity and relationships, in addition to core traits, may increase vulnerability to AN in those with less familial risk.",

Hypotensive patients can, at least initially, be operated under local anesthesia to stabilize blood pressure utilizing a percutaneously inserted occlusion balloon. There was a trend in our study for reduced mortality and morbidity with EVAR, but further studies are required to conclude whether EVAR significantly increases survival and reduces complications.",
    "Our findings suggest that female sex, dosages of prednisolone and cyclosporine, pretransplant weight, and genetic factors are associated with an increased risk of PTDM. The rate of PTDM appeared to be independent of weight gain in the first year posttransplant. Protection against PTDM may be afforded by HLA-DR6 and possibly HLA-DR52. Conversely and higher incidence of diabetes has been associated with HLA-DR8 and HLA-A26.",

    "While dipyrone had no bronchodilator effects on either COPD patients or normal volunteers, it also did not impair the spirometric parameters. Since COPD is a disease characterized by a progressive and largely irreversible airflow limitation, dipyrone has no observable bronchodilator effect. However, since dipyrone does not impair the pulmonary function, it can be used safely in COPD patients when there is an indication.",

    "A large proportion of those patients thought initially to be less severely injured required resources available in a trauma centre, including specialty care, intensive care, and operating room accessibility. Over one-third of these patients had multisystem injuries and almost 20% were considered major trauma, needing prioritisation of care and expertise ideally found in a trauma centre environment. Complications developed in a sizable number of patients. This patient population, because of its heterogeneity and propensity for critical illness, deserves the resources of a trauma centre.",

    "Published case-control studies demonstrate a significant reduced risk of SIDS with pacifier use, particularly when placed for sleep. Encouraging pacifier use is likely to be beneficial on a population-wide basis: 1 SIDS death could be prevented for every 2733 (95% CI: 2416-3334) infants who use a pacifier when placed for sleep (number needed to treat), based on the US SIDS rate and the last-sleep multivariate SOR resulting from this analysis. Therefore, we recommend that pacifiers be offered to infants as a potential method to reduce the risk of SIDS. The pacifier should be offered to the infant when being placed for all sleep episodes, including daytime naps and nighttime sleeps. This is a US Preventive Services Task Force level B strength of recommendation based on the consistency of findings and the likelihood that the beneficial effects will outweigh any potential negative effects. In consideration of potential adverse effects, we recommend pacifier use for infants up to 1 year of age, which includes the peak ages for SIDS risk and the period in which the infant's need for sucking is highest. For breastfed infants, pacifiers should be introduced after breastfeeding has been well established.",

It is likely, however, that biases identified in this study result in high estimates of risk and the true risk due to vasectomy is substantially less than the estimated one. Due to the several limitations and possibilities for reporting biases in this study, the evidence for the estimates of the higher odds ratio for prostate cancer in vasectomised men may not be a strong one. In view of the importance of vasectomy for fertility control, further studies with good design and conduct (the information on vasectomy need to be collected with better reliability) are required to clarify the issue of vasectomy associations with prostate cancer.",

    "CAD prevalence among LTx candidates is low and cannot be accurately predicted by risk factors. Revascularization may be associated with complications, and the time interval between revascularization and LTx may be long. Conversely, certain patients with significant CAD underwent LTx without complications. The practice of routine CA and revascularization prior to LTx should be reconsidered, and perhaps reserved for selected patients with high-risk features.",
    "The mortality rate among survivors of MIs with reduced EF was substantially lower than that reported in the 1990s. The strong decrease in the arrhythmic risk implies a proportional increase in the number of patients needed to treat with a prophylactic defibrillator to prevent one adverse event. The risk of an event may even be sufficiently low to limit the detectable benefit of defibrillators in patients with the prognostic features identified in our study. This argues for additional risk stratification prior to the prophylactic implantation of a defibrillator.",

    "(i) There is no significant correlation between the density of ITL nor PTL marked with D2-40 and the stage of GC. (ii) We did not observe relationship between expression of VEGF-C/D and VEGFR-3 and the stage of GC. (iii) Further studies are needed to fully determine the role of PTL and ITL.",
    "We conclude that although the use of a drain may be associated with a more complex operation, this does not delay the patient's discharge.",
    "Smokers in rural areas are less likely to use the New Zealand Quitline, even after controlling for confounding factors. This suggests that the national quitline is less effective in reaching rural smokers and more attention to the promotion of smoking cessation in rural communities is needed.",
    "The menstrual cycle may affect the outcome of FST and other suppression testing used to diagnose primary aldosteronism. Larger patient numbers and preferably restudy of the same patient in both phases should clarify this and determine the optimum time in the cycle for testing.",
    "As arm span, as an anthropometric measure, remains unchanged over time, it could be used instead of height, as an alternative index (body mass index.1) to the conventional body mass index. Further research is needed to determine the association between body mass index.1 and clinical status parameters to determine optimum cut-off points.",
    "Aggressive locoregional treatment can lead to favorable outcomes for many patients with grossly involved PLNs that is comparable to that of grossly involved inguinal nodes only. We recommend modification of the FIGO stage IVB classification to more accurately reflect the relatively favorable prognosis of patients with PLN involvement.",
    "The diagnosis of EIN in EP may be a better predictor than AEH for endometrial involvement with malignant or pre-malignant neoplasms. The safety of conservative hysteroscopic resection of EP with AEH/EIN is questioned.",
    "In patients affected by endometriosis, the choice between expectant management versus intervention should be personalized: when the estimated probability of natural conception is low, surgery may be considered as a second-line treatment. Conversely, in all other cases surgery should be offered early (as a first-line approach) as it improves the chance of spontaneous conception. The laparoscopic treatment of infertility due to endometriosis must be performed by a skilled specialized surgeon to ensure a complete \"pelvic cleanout\" while respecting the anatomical structures and reducing the risk of fertility impairment due to surgical procedures.",
    "The Healthy Text intervention was effective in inducing significant improvements in sun protection and any type of skin self-examination behaviours.",
    "The results of this study results highlighted that during this life-altering event for adolescents, an open discussion should take place among all of the parties concerned. A better understanding of each party's perspective would allow for better decision making on the resolution of the pregnancy. Health professionals or social workers are there to help pregnant adolescents, romantic partners, and family members make informed choices on how to resolve the pregnancy.",
    "The majority of patients experienced symptomatic improvement following pelvic floor retraining and there was no significant difference in the resulting improvement according to treatment setting. As treatment costs are considerably less in a group setting, group pelvic floor retraining is more cost-effective than individual treatment.",
    "We report on our experiences with five patients for whom manufacturers and health authorities contraindicated the use of negative pressure wound therapy because of its potential to encourage tumor growth, although it was considered to be beneficial for all of these patients. This procedure may offer an alternative to conventional wound dressings at the end of life and improve the quality of life of patients by controlling the three most disabling elements: the odor, exudate, and pain associated with changing the dressings. Miniaturization and lower costs could promote the systematic use of negative pressure wound therapy.",
    "weight perception and weight control behaviour among girls only were related to the accuracy of self-reported BMI; no association was found with self-weighing behaviour and the perceived importance of weight for how adolescents perceive themselves. Knowledge of such factors will allow for a better interpretation and possibly adjustment/correction of results of surveys based on self-reported weight and height data.",
    "Breast stimulation in low-risk primigravidas helps in cervical ripening and increases chances of vaginal delivery.",
    "Given the popularity of tablet computers and the value that middle-aged women place on group interaction to support their PA behaviors, additional research is warranted to determine best strategies for optimizing social support, mitigating technology barriers, and improving engagement in online and mobile health promotion programs targeting middle-aged women.",
    "In this single-site study, children referred from outside EDs with lower pediatric volumes and staffed by nonpediatricians were more likely to be discharged from a children's hospital ED after transport. These transports may represent unnecessary resource use. Outreach education, shared staffing models, and telemedicine are potential methods to address unnecessary transfers.",
    "Most patients under the care of a specialist palliative care service identify a preference for place of death as end of life approaches. Only a minority change their preference once a preferred place has been elicited. We recommend that patients are supported to explore their preferences for PPD as part of specialist palliative care, and that preferences are reviewed as end of life approaches.",

    "This is the first study to show that attention to social features during infancy as well as early sensitive parenting predict the subsequent development of CU traits. Identifying such early atypicalities offers the potential for developing parent-mediated interventions in children at risk for developing CU traits.",
    "Although no clinical diagnostic criteria can distinguish the two conditions at onset, neurophysiological and nerve-biopsy findings specify that in both disorders trigeminal nerve damage manifests as a dissociated neuronopathy affecting myelinated and sparing unmyelinated fibres, thus suggesting similar pathophysiological mechanisms.",
    "Our results are consistent with recent findings showing qualitative and quantitative symptom overlap of burnout with depression. The close interconnection of burnout and depression questions the relevance of a nosological distinction between the two entities. Emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, the two main dimensions of burnout, may be better conceptualized as depressive responses to adverse occupational environments than as components of a separate entity.",
    "Lower immunisation coverage of DTaP/IPV booster and second MMR dose was associated with higher area-level socioeconomic deprivation, although this inequality reduced between 2007/08 and 2010/11 as proportions of children being immunised increased at PCT level, particularly for the most deprived areas. However, coverage is still below the World Health Organisation recommended 95% threshold for Europe.",
    "The Midfoot Fusion Bolt is no longer advised for single-device use only since there have been issues in terms of insufficient stability. However, stable conditions could be achieved with additional screws or plates, respectively. Prospective studies and biomechanical testing for general conclusions are still required to make a meaningful assessment.",
    "Endometrial carcinoma/atypical hyperplasia were commonly observed in GCT patients>40years; based on these data, endometrial sampling should be performed in symptomatic women at least 40years of age. In asymptomatic women<40years, endometrial sampling is of low yield.",
    "Pedicle-screw-based instrumentation does not cause retardation of the development of the spinal canal in young children. Moreover, use of the crosslink added to the screw-rod instrumentation also demonstrates no negative effect on the growth of the spinal canal. Thus, the addition of the crosslink to short screw-based instrumentation is recommended as an alternative to increase fixation stability in growing patients, even in very young pediatric population.",
    "Telephone interrogation of the caller by a flight paramedic is as accurate as ground ambulance crew requests, and both are significantly better than MOI in identifying serious injury. Overtriage remains an issue with all methods.",
    "FIT has a higher sensitivity and a lower specificity for CRC in males than in females. Equal test characteristics can be achieved by allowing separate cut-off values for both sexes. Location and age do not explain the observed differences in sensitivity.",
    "SHBC and MHBC interventions may systematically differ not only in the number of behaviors targeted, but also in the numbers and type of BCTs used. This study demonstrates that intervention content should also be considered when assessing the relative effectiveness of SHBC and MHBC interventions.",
    "The reason why there is an effect on the LoS of level 1 and 2 beneficiaries is that these groups could choose to utilize institutional care services provided by the LTCI, and out-of-pocket costs of institutions are lower than that of hospitals. However, the reason why there is no effect on the LoS of level 3 beneficiaries is that they are not permitted to use the institutional care services in the Korean LTCI policy. Therefore, we recommend a modification in the LTCI system that facilitates the use of long-term care institutional services by level 3 beneficiaries without conflicting Korea's LTCI principle to promote home-based care services instead of the institutional care services.",
    "Ultrasonic advanced energy may provide benefit in laparoscopic para-aortic lymphadenectomy, facilitating surgical ergonomics, but did not decrease post-surgery lymphocele.",
    "Vaginal hysterectomy in larger non-prolapsed uteri takes longer (mean 38 min longer) and is associated with more blood loss (mean increase 242 ml) compared to normal-sized uteri but is not associated with a significant increase in complication rates.",
    "The increasing numbers of IMID patients, many using immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy, show similar travel patterns as non-IMID travelers. Thus, they are exposed to the same travel health risks, vaccine-preventable infections being one among them. Particularly, in view of the fact that live attenuated vaccines are less often administered to IMID patients more data are needed on the safety and immunogenicity of vaccines and on travel-specific risks to be able to offer evidence-based pre-travel health advice.",
    "The beneficial effect of evidence-based polytherapy on mortality following AMI is observed also in older populations. Nevertheless, the risk-benefit ratio associated with antiplatelet therapy is less favorable with increasing age.",
    "Identifying socio-demographic variables and comorbidities that affect hormonal therapy symptom burden is essential for offering adequate support for breast cancer survivors.",
    "Two-dimensional GLS is easy to obtain and accurately detects LVEF≤40% in unselected patients. GLS may be especially helpful when a suboptimal acoustic window makes LVEF measurement by Simpson's biplane method difficult and in atrial fibrillation patients with low heart rate variability.",
    "In our series, adult patients who became pain free after unilateral pyeloplasty for UPJO did not have persistent obstruction of renal drainage on renography. Routine diuresis renogram to assess drainage and differential renal function in patients who become pain free after pyeloplasty for UPJO may not be necessary. If objective evidence of postoperative outcome is required, then a single renogram at 3 months is recommended.",
    "Multiple cannulated screws remain the preferred treatment for most surgeons treating undisplaced fractures; however, there is an equal divide in preference between multiple screws and the SHS for displaced fractures. This increased preference for the SHS contradicts previous survey and small trial data recommending multiple screws for all fracture patterns. The lack of surgeon consensus and the high rates of fracture complications associated with fixation of young femoral neck fractures supports the need for definitive clinical trials to optimise patient important outcomes.",
    "The projected increase of EC over next 16 years indicates the need for close monitoring of EC trends.",
    "CKD is more often observed in patients with valvular AF. In population with non-valvular AF decreased eGFR is associated with permanent type of AF and with higher CHA2DS2VASc and HAS-BLED score. Among valvular AF patients there are no differences in type of AF between patients with and without CKD. There is the correlation between CKD and AF perpetuation but only in non-valvular population.",
    "Our study shows that most patients undergoing nephrectomy for cancer are able to follow HBPM. It should be encouraged for detecting high BP or proteinuria, especially if antiangiogenic therapies are envisaged because of the supplementary risk of hypertension and proteinuria induced by these treatments.",
    "PFC BDNF does not follow a normative linear age effect in schizophrenia patients as they grow older, which may represent a 'floor effect' due to earlier decline or a survivor cohort of older patient donors who are less susceptible to a schizophrenia-related pathological aging process.",
    "This study indicates that based on a one-year benefit-cost analysis that prehospital treatment of acute stroke is highly cost-effective across a wide range of possible scenarios. It is the highest when the staff size of the Mobile Stroke Unit can be reduced, for example, by the use of telemedical support from hospital experts. Although efficiency is positively related to population density, benefit-cost ratios can be greater than 1 even in rural settings.",
    "Despite the high rate of radiographic complications related to breaking or loosening of syndesmotic screws in almost one third of all cases, more than 98% of all patients remain asymptomatic and do not require a scheduled hardware removal. The routine removal of syndesmotic positioning screws does not appear to be justified from a patient safety perspective.",
    "Victimised adolescents who were better able to forgive themselves were more likely to report lower levels of psychopathology, while bullying adolescents who were unable to forgive others were more likely to report higher levels of psychopathology. This suggests a greater role for forgiveness within future research, intervention and policy on bullying. Forgiveness can form a valuable part of preventative and educational anti-bullying programmes.",

    "There seems to be a facial variant of EF. These observations could not only expand the clinical spectrum of EF but also enlarge the differential diagnosis of facial pain.",
    "The proposed global framework for monitoring UHC will only be feasible in Kenya if systemic challenges are addressed. While the infrastructure for reporting the MDG related indicators is in place, Kenya will require continued international investment to extend its capacity to meet the data requirements of the proposed UHC monitoring framework, particularly for the CCI-related indicators.",
    "Decision regret following treatment was low and relatively stable over time for most women. Those facing an additional diagnosis of breast cancer following treatment may be at risk for elevated regret-related distress.",
    "Our findings suggest that associations between perceived neighborhood challenges and PA are shaped by the context in which the individual lives. Our study provides empirical evidence that individual perceptions and observed neighborhood characteristics are joint contributors to PA and suggest the need for continued research to characterize the complexity of individual and contextual factors that contribute to PA.",
    "In the short term, managers have a limited ability to influence patient satisfaction scores, and it appears that working through frontline providers (doctors and nurses) is critical to success. In addition, results indicate that not all patient satisfaction gains are cost neutral and there may be added costs to some forms of quality. Therefore, quality is not costless as is often argued.",
    "Due to the single-centre, observational nature of this study, the equivalent outcomes between those thrombolysed by a stroke neurologist versus those thrombolysed by a stroke physician must be interpreted with caution pending further studies. Nevertheless, in the current setting, no signal for harm has been detected. This study is unique as it is the first to our knowledge comparing outcomes between a neurologist and non-neurologist following thrombolysis.",
    "The low IGN recurrence rate even with ACI and the feasibility of salvage of isolated IGN recurrence indicated that routine elective IGN irradiation is not necessary for rectal cancer with ACI.",
    "Infants with untreated SSC demonstrate abnormal speech sound processing. Atypicalities are detectable as early as 6 months of age and may represent precursors to long-term language delay. Electrophysiological assessments provide a precise examination of neural processing in SSC and hold potential as a future modality to examine the effects of surgical treatment on brain development.",
    "Our retrospective series shows that endoscopic and open repairs of metopic craniosynostosis are equivalent in improving hypotelorism and trigonocephaly at 1-year follow-up. Additional studies are necessary to better define minor differences in morphology, which may result from the different techniques.",
    "A novel diagnostic test should improve diagnostic thinking and allow for better decision making in a significant fraction of cases. Our findings do not support that HRV metrics add value over routine vital signs in terms of prehospital identification of hemorrhaging patients who receive PRBC transfusion.",
    "Further research that seeks to investigate the effects observed in more detail and to evaluate them against other forms of treatment and/or no-treatment controls is warranted. This could be achieved by way of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial that evaluated Chinese medicine against orthodox medical care.",

    "These findings suggest that high levels of maternal care may act as a protective factor against future revictimization among military service members. These findings have the potential to inform both prevention and intervention efforts.",
    "In genome-wide association analysis of the Simons Simplex Collection sample, reducing phenotypic heterogeneity had at most a modest impact on genetic homogeneity. Our results are based on a relatively small sample, one with greater homogeneity than the entire population; if they apply more broadly, they imply that analysis of subphenotypes is not a productive path forward for discovering genetic risk variants in ASD.",
    "There was evidence that the increased risk of cancer associated with diabetes was confined to persons who reported low levels of physical activity, or who were overweight or obese.",
    "MIS-TLIF is a safe and viable option for lumbar fusion in morbidly obese patients and, compared with open-TLIF, resulted in similar improvement in pain and functional disability. Postoperative complications rates between both cohorts were also not significantly divergent.",

    "The prevalence of iron deficiency in the immigrant population is higher than in non-immigrants. Immigration and the category of employment are risk factors for iron deficiency, as starting baby cereals before 9 months is a protective factor. Good socioeconomic conditions in Switzerland, the quality of food for pregnant women and young infants may be the explanation. A study up to five years of age is necessary before drawing general conclusions on infancy.",
    "A diagnosis of atrophic vaginitis on Papanicolaou test is reliably associated with increased numbers of neutrophils. A diagnosis of atrophic pattern is indicative of low numbers of neutrophils. As the Papanicolaou test diagnosis of atrophic vaginitis does not correlate with clinical symptoms, a single diagnostic term that does not suggest a disease process would more reliably communicate cytology findings to clinicians.",
    "Findings suggest significant differences in e-health information-seeking behaviors among African American Internet users-these differences are mostly related to personal and family health concerns and experiences. Targeted online e-health resources and interventions can educate and empower a significant subset of the population.",
    "Fasciotomy wounds that are not able to be primarily closed during their first postfasciotomy surgical procedure are rarely closed through DPC techniques. Early skin grafting of these wounds should be considered, especially in the clinical setting of an open injury, because it significantly decreases the length of hospital stay. Other techniques that avoid repeated debridements and attempted closures might also help reduce hospital stay.",

    "This study suggests that MTHFR gene polymorphisms can not be used as a marker for the assessment of cardiovascular risk in T2DM patients.",
    "The results indicate that mycorrhizal physiology is relatively fixed in G. repens, and changes in the amount and direction of C flow between plant and fungus were not observed to depend on light availability. The orchid may instead react to low-light sites through increased clonal growth. The orchid does not compensate for low leaf total N and chlorophyll concentrations by using a (13)C- and (15)N-enriched fungal source.",
    "Our results suggest that cardiac abnormalities are not common in type II and type III SMA. These findings provide no evidence to support a more accurate cardiac surveillance or changes in the existing standards of care.",
    "Each unit of FFP increased VTE risk by 25% in patients who required less than 4 U of PRBCs. In patients who required 4 U or greater PRBCs, FFP administration conferred no increased risk of VTE. This suggests that FFP should be used cautiously when early hemodynamic stability can be achieved with less than 4 U of PRBCs.",
    "MLL is a rare diagnosis but is encountered in large-volume breast practices. The findings are nonspecific with a range of imaging appearances. No imaging test is reliable for differentiating MLL from other suspicious lesions or lesions with associated atypia. Surgery is clearly warranted for MLL associated with atypia at core needle biopsy because it may be upgraded to malignancy upon excision. However, if the presence of atypia at excision of benign MLL will change clinical management, then benign MLL at core needle biopsy warrants surgical excision in some cases. In patients whose treatment will not change if atypia is found at excision, close surveillance with short-interval follow-up is a reasonable alternative.",

    "Flow cytometric and plasma biomarkers of monocyte activation indicate an ongoing systemic inflammatory response to HIV infection, characterised by persistent alterations of CD16+ monocyte expression profiles and elevated sCD14 levels, that are not corrected by antiretroviral therapy and likely to be prognostically significant. In contrast, sCD163 and CXCL10 levels declined on antiretroviral therapy, suggesting multiple activation pathways revealed by these biomarkers. Incorporation of these assays into routine clinical care is feasible and warrants further consideration, particularly in light of emerging therapeutic strategies that specifically target innate immune activation in HIV infection.",

    "LRFA of HCC is safe, feasible and achieves excellent results in selected patients. LRFA should be the first-line technique for subcapsular lesions as it minimizes the risk of tumoural seeding and improves ICR. Proximity to gallbladder interferes in treatment efficacy (lower rate of ICR and lower rate of SCR).",
    "Shock index compared favourably with conventional vital signs in predicting ICU admission and other outcomes in PPH, even after adjusting for confounding; SI<0.9 provides reassurance, whereas SI ≥ 1.7 indicates a need for urgent attention. In low-resource settings this simple parameter could improve outcomes. It was not possible to adjust for resuscitative measures administered following vital sign measurement that may have influenced the outcome.",

Further studies are needed to determine long-term benefits and to identify which patients are more likely to respond to this modality of therapy.",
    "Our results demonstrate that 18F-FDG PET is relevant for diagnostic purposes compared with WBX in relapsing MM. The enhanced uptake of 18F-FDG PET is likely related to the activation of the HIF-2α signaling pathway but probably independent of hypoxia-induced signaling in view of the negative findings on both 18F-FAZA-PET and HIF-1α expression.",

    "RV was the sole identified cause of IS in 13% of our cohort. These young patients with IS and RV may have a variant of RCVS, related to an increased susceptibility to vasoactive agents in some individuals. RV in our patients differs from the classical characteristics of RCVS by the absence of thunderclap headache, reversible brain oedema and subarachnoid or intracranial haemorrhage. Intracranial arteries should be looked for, by appropriate vascular imaging, in young patients with IS at the acute stage and during the follow-up period.",

    "The reduced prevalence of current smokers among PD subjects as compared to healthy controls is consistent with previous findings, suggesting a possible neuroprotective effect of smoking. However, it could be due, at least in part, to the increased prevalence of former smokers among PD patients, that were more prone to quit smoking as compared to healthy controls. We suggest that smoking cessation could be an early preclinical condition occurring in PD.",
    "MDD thus appeared to be a confounding variable in the relationship between alcohol use and AUD, and self-reported measures of AUD seemed to be overestimated by depressive people. This result brings into question the accuracy of self-reported measures of substance use disorders. Furthermore, it adds to the emerging debate about the usefulness of substance use disorder as a concept, when heavy substance use itself appears to be a sensitive and reliable indicator.",

    "In OTA 43C type pilon fractures, 8 out of 10 studied commercially available implants precontoured for the distal tibia, do not adequately stabilize the three primary fracture fragments typically seen in these injuries. Anterolateral plates were superior in addressing the coronal primary fracture line across the apex of the plafond, and buttressing the zone of comminution. None of the available plates can substitute for an understanding of the fracture planes and fragments typically seen in complex intra-articular tibia fractures and the addition of a second plate is necessary for adequate stability.",

    "There was no difference in VTE rates based on patient sex, even after controlling for menopausal status. Aggressive VTE screening of over 8,700 patients did identify several other patient populations at increased risk of developing VTE. More intensive VTE prophylaxis may be appropriate in these patients.",
    "There was a statistically significant differ - ence in the characterization of RC FI between the sagittal and coronal planes in the setting of a large or massive tear, likely related to incomplete visualization of the musculature on sagittal imaging secondary to muscle and tendon retrac - tion and more complete visualization on coronal imaging.

    "Our findings demonstrate that KCNH1 mutations cause TMBTS and expand the mutational spectrum of KCNH1 in TMBTS. In addition, all cases of TMBTS were reviewed and compared to ZLS. We suggest that the two syndromes are a continuum and that the variability in the phenotypes is the result of the involvement of genetic modifiers.",
    "Physicians are not likely to adopt recommendations provided by false positive alerts in patient-safety-related CDSS. If reporting only the adoption rate of CDSS as a whole without differentiating between TP and FP alerts, the effects of TP and FP alerts will be mixed, and thus, will lead to an underestimation of system effectiveness.",

    "When the results were pooled for all three joints, there was a statistically significant higher local bone density demonstrated on the convex side of an intra-articular fracture. However, while this relationship was clearly exhibited in the knee, this was less evident in the other two joints; in the ankle the reverse was true, and the local bone adjacent to the concavity was found to have greater density. This suggests local bone density plays only a minor role in determining the nature of intra-articular fractures.",

    "Both male and female anhedonic smokers were more likely to be abstinent, which contrasts with prior research indicating that anhedonia is a risk factor for difficulty quitting. This unexpected finding may be explained by a possible selective benefit of nicotine patch therapy, which has been observed in some studies to have antidepressant effects.",
    "Findings suggest that for women who conceived relatively easily, diet and physical activity behaviour during pregnancy is primarily based upon a combination of automatic judgements, physical sensations, and perceptions of what pregnant women are supposed to do. Health professionals and other credible sources appear to exert less influence. As such, pregnancy alone may not create a 'teachable moment'. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Significant life events can be cues to action with relation to health behaviour change. However, much of the empirical research in this area has focused on negative health experiences such as receiving a false-positive screening result and hospitalization, and in relation to unequivocally negative behaviours such as smoking. It is often suggested that pregnancy, as a major life event, is a 'teachable moment' (TM) for lifestyle behaviour change due to an increase in motivation towards health and regular contact with health professionals. However, there is limited evidence for the utility of the TM model in predicting or promoting behaviour change. What does this study add? Two groups of women emerged from our study: the women who had experienced difficulties in conceiving and had received fertility treatment, and those who had conceived without intervention. The former group's experience of pregnancy was characterized by a sense of vulnerability and anxiety over sustaining the pregnancy which influenced every choice they made about their diet and physical activity. For the latter group, decisions about diet and physical activity were made immediately upon discovering their pregnancy, based upon a combination of automatic judgements, physical sensations, and perceptions of what is normal or 'good' for pregnancy. Among women with relatively trouble-free conception and pregnancy experiences, the necessary conditions may not be present to create a 'teachable moment'. This is due to a combination of a reliance on non-reflective decision-making, perception of low risk, and little change in affective response or self-concept.",
    "We conclude that embryo vitrification with warming may affect some perinatal outcomes since preeclampsia is increased compared to fresh blastocyst transfer. However, other perinatal outcomes such as low birthweight and preterm delivery rate are not affected. Fresh blastocyst transfers should be considered when possible as they may reduce the incidence of preeclampsia.",
    "Administration of Erythropoietin coupled with oral tapered steroids for patients sustaining iatrogenic nerve injuries in total hip and knee arthroplasty demonstrated faster and more complete recovery of motor and sensory function compared to previous reports in the literature.

    "The overall incidence could be reduced to a level below 20 %. Particularly in patients with a high risk of PONV, TIVA could clearly reduce the incidence. However, the incidence in patients with 2 risk factors is still high (30-39 %). Therefore, it is important to reconsider the effort involved with risk screening and individually adapting anesthesia. Risk stratification means a pre- and perioperative effort. Therefore, we advocate a more liberal approach for PONV prophylaxis.",

Although it has no way of showing a causative or clinically significant relation, this study did show that the cam-type deformity markers of increasing AA and decreasing AFNO were significantly associated with SOA in a large osteological collection.",
    "Race and SES were both associated with larger tumor size at diagnosis. Larger tumor size, negative hormone receptor status, and Hispanic and Asian race were associated with lack of receipt of BCS. Breast cancer screening programs should target both minority and low SES groups. Rates of BCS should be interpreted cautiously when used as a quality metric because of the multiple factors, including tumor size and biology, contributing to its use.",

Our study shows that in such children having specific IgE levels below established cut-off levels reported in other studies predicting positive challenge outcomes, re-evaluation of clinical reactivity to food by DBPCFC should be considered, even when there are no indications in history that anaphylaxis has resolved. DBPCFCs can be performed safely in these children, although there is a potential risk for severe reactions.",

    "Although the heterosexual male:female ratio for gonorrhoea is one readily available and proxy measure of disease control and tracing efficiency, its sole use should be interpreted with caution. A time lag across quarters between patient and partner attendance and other recording anomalies may mislead. Ratios should therefore be interpreted in the context of partner notification outcomes, which give a more reliable measure of efficiency. The use of the ratio in critical evaluation of a unit's efficiency should be but one part of a package of measures.",
    "Among STD clinic attendees, suspicion of genital herpes infection may translate into partner protective behaviour, but only for a minority of people and only with respect to sex with steady partners. Clinic-based and community-based education programs may benefit public health by teaching people (especially single women) how to effectively recognise symptoms of primary genital herpes infections. Reversing the often prevailing ethic of genital herpes as a 'community secret' will clearly be a challenge to these education programs.",

Similarly, the mRNA expressions of both aggrecan, type II collagen, Sox-9, BMP-2, and BMP-7 except for type I collagen were increased significantly when TGF-beta(1) and rhBMP-2 were combined. The positive immunofluorescence stained cell numbers for aggrecan, type I, II collagen, BMP-2 and BMP-7 were also increased after each TGF-beta(1) and rhBMP-2 treatment, and also more increased significantly in the aggrecan, type I, II collagen, BMP-2, and 7 when they were used jointly.",
    "These three anti-VEGF agents did not show any therapeutic effect on stopping CNV leakage in rats. Previous experiments with ranibizumab in monkeys resulted in a significant decrease in leakage of CNV. The difference may be due to the fact that both ranibizumab and bevacizumab are humanized and species-specific. There are several studies evaluating the effect of bevacizumab in non-primates. Since bevacizumab is humanized, the results of studies on non-primates may not be similar to humans and non-human primates.",

    "The present report provides data indicating that ADNs, as described by the DSM-IV, are not unique to the Hispanic culture and are experienced by non-Hispanic individuals at similar rates to Hispanic-endorsement. The findings are consistent with the DSM-IV assertion that ADNs and PAs are distinct syndromes.",
    "The association between plasma and tissue sample cytokine concentrations suggests that plasma cytokine levels reflect the extent and severity of valvular lesions. Statins may attenuate progressive calcific valve stenosis. Statins also affect TNF-alpha and IL-10 plasma levels. These associations may help not only predict the progression but also attenuate the deterioration of valvular lesions. Verification of these results in larger scale studies is required before definite conclusions can be drawn.",
    "Although horse-related injury presentations are uncommon, severe injuries do occur. Patients presenting with severe horse-related injuries do not always activate a full trauma team response based on current trauma team activation criteria. These severe injury presentations are supported by a limited trauma team response, which activates on the mechanism of injury. The effectiveness of this as a contingency system needs to be evaluated.",
    "These results suggest that anti-beta(2)-GPI-ab may be considered a biological marker for obstetric APS.",
    "TURP mainly samples transitional-zone tissue where tumours are relatively uncommon, and have a good prognosis. Our series of incidental TURP-detected cancers showed an incidence in keeping with published data, and favourable histological and clinical outcomes. We suggest the lack of tissue should not discourage the use of laser prostatectomy surgery.",
    "If the ED syndromic surveillance system had been operating it could have identified the outbreak earlier than the paediatrician's notification. This may have permitted an earlier public health response.",
    "Our results show that BRAF, KRAS and PIK3CA mutations occur prior to malignant transformation demonstrating that these oncogenic alterations are primary genetic events in colorectal carcinogenesis. Further, we show that BRAF mutations occur in association with CIMP phenotype in colorectal serrated polyps and verified that colorectal serrated polyps and MSI CRC show a similar frequency of BRAF mutations. These results support that BRAF mutations harbour a mild oncogenic effect in comparison to KRAS and suggest that BRAF mutant colorectal cells need to accumulate extra epigenetic alterations in order to acquire full transformation and evolve to MSI CRC.",
    "Transferred patients were vastly different than non-transferred patients. However, even after a rigorous propensity-score analysis, transferred patients had lower mortality than non-transferred patients. Mortality was similar in rural and urban hospitals. Identifying patients who derive the greatest benefit from transfer may help physicians faced with the complex decision of whether to transfer a patient suffering an acute MI.",

    "Patients with non-distal rectal bleeding should be prioritized over other indications in a strategy of rapid diagnosis of CRC. Age equal to or more than 50 years should also be considered because this factor seems to reduce NND. Distal bleeding, abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits had low PPV and were associated with other diagnoses than CRC. Consequently, prioritization of these factors would be inefficient.",

    "This study shows that fewer patients are receiving exercise counseling to help lower blood pressure and improve health outcomes. However, patients seem to follow the advice when given. Given the magnitude of poorly controlled hypertension, these findings should alert healthcare providers to find innovative means of physical activity recommendation to improve health outcomes.",
    "HEV viral load was found to be significantly higher (P<0.05) in pregnant patients compared to the nonpregnant. Pregnancy appears to be a risk factor for viral replication. The viral copies of HEV in FHF pregnant women were comparatively higher when compared to AVH pregnant women, which may be related to the severity of the disease in these patients. We could detect only one genotype (genotype 1) in our study population. Thus in the absence of other genotypes in this population, the impact of genotype could not be adequately assessed in this study.",

    "Higher quality of cancer screening experience was significantly associated with likelihood of having routine breast and cervical cancer screening. Further studies should explore factors that affect quality of the screening experience, including facility characteristics and interactions with medical staff.",
    "Our study highlights the difficulty of extrapolating from intraspecific studies to understand the genetic basis of interspecific adaptive phenotypic evolution, even with a gene whose structure-function relationships are as well understood as MC1R as confounding variation make clear genotype/phenotype associations difficult at the macroevolutionary scale. However, the identification of substitutions in the black and black-necked swan that are known to be associated with melanic phenotypes, suggests Cygnus may be another example where there appears to be convergent evolution at MC1R. This study therefore provides a novel example where previously described intraspecific genotype/phenotype associations occur at the macroevolutionary level.",

    "The strategies that promote competition among HMOs in the current market setting may not lead to improved HMO quality. It is possible that price competition dominates, with purchasers and consumers preferring lower premiums at the expense of improved quality, as measured by HEDIS and CAHPS. It is also possible that the fragmentation associated with competition hinders quality improvement.",
    "This study shows that FC is beneficial in the detection of malignant and premalignant lesions, if there is negative white-light cystoscopy but positive urine cytology. The immediate identification of the exact site of a malignant lesion during FC enables the physician to diagnose and treat these patients more accurately and with no delay.",

    "While the use of RDTs in all suspected cases has been shown to be cost-saving when parasite prevalence among clinically diagnosed malaria cases is low to moderate, findings show that targeting RDTs at the group older than six years and treating children less than six years on the basis of clinical diagnosis is even more cost-saving. In semi-immune populations, young children carry the highest risk of severe malaria and many healthcare providers would find it harder to deny antimalarials to those who test negative in this age group.",

    "We show that red fluorescence is widespread among marine fishes. Many features indicate that it is used as a private communication mechanism in small, benthic, pair- or group-living fishes. Many of these species show quite cryptic colouration in other parts of the visible spectrum. High inter-specific variation in red fluorescence and its association with structures used in intra-specific signalling further corroborate this view. Our findings challenge the notion that red light is of no importance to marine fish, calling for a reassessment of its role in fish visual ecology in subsurface marine environments.",
    "The study found no support for the hypothesis that an increase in private sector contraceptive supply leads to higher MCPR inequality. The findings suggest that continued public sector supply of contraceptives to the poorest women protects against increased MCPR inequality.

    "Although students who acted as PAL tutors performed better than students who did not in final-year examinations, this difference was small and attributable to the students' background academic abilities. High-achieving students appear to be self-selecting as peer-tutors and their enhanced performance in LSOs may reflect their inherent academic abilities. Although peer-tutoring in itself did not lead to enhanced examination performance, further studies are required as many factors, such as the proximity of examinations and previous tutoring, can potentially affect the relationship between peer-tutoring experience and examination performance.",

    "These observations suggest the presence of a rapid AQP-mediated water exchange between the endolymph, the cells of the cochlear duct and the perilymph. The subcellular colocalization of Kir4.1 and AQP4 in epithelial supporting cells indicates functional coupling of potassium and water flow in the cochlea. Finally, this offers an explanation for the hearing impairment observed in individuals with mutations in the AQP4 gene.",
    "In conclusion, it is possible that one or more of the vCJD cases that received a blood transfusion derived from an individual not known to have vCJD were infected by the blood transfusion. However, the evidence for this is weak, and the absence of a past history of transfusion in most cases of vCJD excludes a large number of unrecognised transfusion-transmitted cases.",

    "QDU patients with FUN were younger and had less serious diseases than controls including more viral and less bacterial infections and fewer malignancies. Mainly owing to untimely diagnostic reports, time-to-diagnosis was longer in QDU patients. Cost-savings in QDU were substantial. Using objective tools to evaluate the condition severity and general health status of FUN patients could help decide the most appropriate setting for their diagnostic study.",

Quality improvement initiatives using patient satisfaction as a proxy for quality of care should account for patients' baseline depression as a potential confounder especially in this age group.",
    "The pain VAS is a valid tool for measuring pain at one point in time. However, the pain VAS does not behave linearly and SRMs vary along the trait of pain. Consequently, Minimum Clinically Important Differences using raw data, or change scores in general, are invalid as these will either under- or overestimate true change; raw pain VAS data should not be used as a primary outcome measure or to inform parametric-based Randomised Controlled Trial power calculations in research studies; and Rasch analysis should be used to convert ordinal data to interval data prior to data interpretation.",

    "Our findings suggest that there is a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity associated with CBE added to mammography. This tendency is greater in those 40-50 years of age than in those 60-70 years of age. We consider that CBE may be omitted from breast cancer screening among women aged 60 and 70 years. Furthermore, another modality to complement mammography screening in younger Japanese women is expected.",

    "Consistent findings of no increased prescribing of risperidone post generics with limited specific demand-side measures suggests no 'spillover' effect from one class to another encouraging the preferential prescribing of generic atypical antipsychotic drugs. This is exacerbated by the complexity of the disease area and differences in the side-effects between treatments. There appeared to be no clinical issues with generic risperidone, and prices inversely reflected measures to enhance their utilisation.",
    "PAP in children from la Réunion Island is characterized by an early onset, associated liver involvement, poor prognosis and frequent progression to lung fibrosis, despite whole-lung lavages treatment. The geographic clustering of patients and the detection of many familial links between most of the cases strongly suggest a genetic etiology, with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.",

    "We have observed that benzene in ambient air is strongly associated with the triggering of MI. This novel finding needs confirmation. If so, this would mean that not only diesel vehicles, the main particulate matter emitters, but also gasoline-fueled cars--main benzene emitters-, should be taken into account for public health action.",
    "The SRC was deemed a success because it solved challenges regarding the use of television in everyday lives of families.

    "Identification rates of ARM nodes can be improved by injecting the blue dye in the upper medial aspect of the arm at the time of induction. Majority of the arm nodes lie between the axillary vein and the first intercostobrachial nerve. It is difficult to preserve the ARM nodes in patients of LABC, who have had good response to NACT and in patients of LABC with poor response to NACT, the incidence of metastasis in ARM nodes is quite high. Therefore, ARM is not a feasible option in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.",
    "Dissolution testing, while simplistic, is a widely used and accepted method for comparing drug release from different formulations as an indicator for in vivo bioavailability. Thickened fluids have the potential to retard drug dissolution when used at the thickest levels. These findings highlight potential clinical implications of the addition of these agents to medications for the purpose of dose delivery and indicate that further investigation of thickened fluids and their potential to influence therapeutic outcomes is warranted.",
    "Modification in legislation for bioequivalence of antiepileptic drugs is suggested, not only with constraint of AUC0-t 90% CI to 0.90-1.11, but also with limitation of the CV to 15%, as to assure similar variance in pharmacokinetics and diminish the risk of critical plasma-level fluctuation when switching between generic and reference formulations. Although most generics presented differences ≤ 10% in AUC0-t compared to their references, some narrow therapeutic index drugs displayed differences that could be clinically significant after product substitution.",

    "Our findings support the hypothesis that long-term insight in psychosis seems to be, to some extent, determined from first presentation, showing trait-like properties. A subgroup of 'lacking insight' patients, which is characterized by a diagnosis of schizophrenia, lower levels of premorbid adjustment and less severe depressive symptoms at baseline might benefit from special interventions targeted at enhancing insight from their first contact with psychiatric services.",
    "Our data demonstrate a strong correlation between these three HACs following bariatric surgery and factors intrinsic to the bariatric patient population. This calls into question the non-payment policy for inherent patient factors on which they cannot have impact. These findings are important to help inform health care policy decisions regarding access to care for bariatric surgery patients.",
    "Patients who had blood transfusion at the end of life lived significantly longer than the anaemic patients who were not transfused. This study remarks that blood transfusions should not be withheld from terminal cancer patients in palliative care.",

    "Pregnancy likely ameliorates the short-term course of RRMS in terms of the rates of relapses and progression to irreversible disability. Over the long term, it appears to have no material impact on these outcomes, and might in fact accelerate the rate of transition to SPMS.",
    "Our results thus show that similar measurements of household poverty-wealth have produced varying relationships with respect to experience of spousal violence in six sub-Saharan African countries. In other words, experience of violence cuts across all household poverty-wealth statuses and therefore may not provide enough explanations on whether household-poverty necessarily serves to facilitate the ending of violence. These results suggest that eliminating violence against women in sub-Sahara Africa requires a comprehensive approach rather than addressing household poverty-wealth alone.",
    "Our study demonstrates that different histopathological patterns, including GC presence, reflect different cytokine expression and different clinical subsets. We believe that the combined immunofluorescence/molecular approach in MSGs would help to tailor diagnostic and therapeutic approach for different subsets of pSS patients.",

Despite the diversity of the state, the disparity of blacks in academic medicine in Florida only marginally exceeds the national average. Asians and Hispanics make up the same percentage of academic physicians, but there are 10 times more Hispanics in the state. More research and programming are needed to further define and arrive at solutions to this problem.",

The histologic information obtained by CNB specimen may reduce the needs for repetitive fine needle aspirations or diagnostic surgery.",
    "The cost-effectiveness of KardioPro differs substantially according to the group being targeted. Depending on the willingness-to-pay, it may be reasonable to only offer KardioPro to patients at high risk of further cardiovascular events. This high-risk group could be identified from routine statutory health insurance data. However, the long-term consequences of KardioPro still need to be evaluated.",

    "Findings support the \"escape from awareness\" model of binge eating among women, and suggest that targeting cognitive avoidance in binge eating treatment may be a promising clinical avenue. Future research may benefit from exploring the broader construct of experiential avoidance to determine if the gender differences in cognitive avoidance observed in this study are indicative of a larger pattern of avoidance behavior, and if factors other than cognitive avoidance may have greater relevance for men.",
    "In this selected population of COPD patients, a high proportion of patients remained in the same spirometric GOLD grade or improved in a long-term follow-up. These findings suggest that once diagnosed, COPD is usually a non-progressive disease.",

    "In private practice vascular medicine, it seems possible to mention the subject of advance directives, as recommended by the French authorities. The procedure is well perceived by the patients. It nevertheless implies allotting a non-negligible amount of additional consultation time. The reinforcement of the doctor-patient relationship suggested by these results should be confirmed by a qualitative study made up of meetings.",
    "Reconstruction of the proximal tibia with either endoprosthetic replacement or osteoarticular allograft appears to offer similar reconstruction failures rates. The primary cause of failure for allograft was infection and for endoprosthesis was mechanical complications. We believe that the treating surgeon should have both options available for treatment of patients with malignant or aggressive tumors of the proximal tibia. (S)he might consider an allograft in a younger patient to achieve better extensor mechanism function, whereas in an older patient or one with a poorer prognosis where return to function and ambulation quickly is desired, an endoprosthesis may be advantageous.",
    "The confluence of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides genetic risk load has an additive effect on IHD risk. The interaction between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and IHD genetic load is more than multiplicative, supporting the hazardous impact on atherosclerosis progression of the combination of inflammation and increased lipid levels. The capacity of risk factor confluence to improve IHD risk prediction is questionable. Further studies in larger samples are warranted to confirm and expand our results.",
    "The Brief-BESTest was confirmed to have some acceptable-to-good reliability indexes when calculated according to Classical Test Theory, but the scale showed fairly limited sensitivity to change. Rasch analysis indicated that item selection should be improved from a psychometric point of view. Item redundancy needs to be reduced, and the metric coverage of the measured construct needs to be improved with new items.",
    "Blood drawn from the site of varicose veins appears to have significantly increased concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 when compared to the same patient's arm blood. This supports the hypothesis that inflammation is activated from the tissues drained by the varicose veins.",
    "Intravenous thrombolysis rates in the Netherlands more than doubled between 2005 and 2012, in parallel with a large decline in mean DNT. We found no convincing evidence for a relationship between stroke patient volume per hospital and thrombolysis rate or DNT.",
    "Black people in London were half as likely as whites to have COPD after adjusting for lower smoking rates in blacks. It seems likely that the differences observed were due either to ethnic differences in the way cigarettes were smoked or to ethnic differences in susceptibility to COPD.",
    "Our data, in conjunction with those of the 12 previously described subjects, suggest the existence of a currently unrecognized inaugural epilepsy syndrome of sporadic AD. Such a syndrome could be called the epileptic variant of AD because seizures are its sole feature for more than 2.5 years.",
    "Facing spousal cancer during child-rearing years seemed to have a substantial impact on partners' mental health and an adverse impact on their quality of life. Accordingly, these partners' self-care abilities may be reduced. Received social support may reduce the multiple burdens and consequently allow for enhancement of self-care.",

    "PODH is a common complication following hybrid esophagectomy and MIO. Given the high mortality from emergency repair, careful thought is needed to identify surgical techniques to prevent PODH forming when minimal access esophagectomy are performed. Upper GI surgeons need to have a low index of suspicion to investigate and treat patients for this complication.",

    "Our experience indicates that LSG is a safe procedure with satisfactory three-year late weight loss in patients with preoperative BMI<50 kg/m2. Promising results, in terms of improvements of comorbidities, were also observed. These results make LSG one of the most attractive first stage surgical procedure for morbid obesity.",
    "We can confirm that the symptomatic description of the disorder in this patient fits the classical descriptions of PP. Two elements make the PP different from other acute psychoses: the context of pregnancy and delirium focused on the child which can lead to a child murder. The absence of a framework precisely defining the PP does not improve its prevention and can lead to legal attitudes rather than medical care. Men suffering from acute psychosis in a context of pregnancy are submitted to the same risks as women. It is necessary to emphasize descriptions of PP in men to redefine the disease and consider that this entity involves both men and women.",
    "The computerized tool may provide a well-accepted therapeutic adjuvant even though it doesn't improve the therapeutic effect. Using a personalized symptom-provocation task reveals the parallel evolution of symptoms and neurobehavioral markers through CBT. Despite the difficulty of improving an evidence-based therapy, mid-therapy results call for investigating the possible adjustments of treatment strategies at an early stage.",

    "When comparing the survival of old and young livers in the HCC+/HCV- group, the elderly livers appear to have a better outcome (P = .05); on the other hand, the same analysis in the HCC-/HCV+ group shows a worse outcome for old-aged grafts (P = .026). Therefore, the present study suggests that elderly livers should be allocated to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and should be avoided in HCV+ recipients.",

    "This study shows that solifenacin treatment is effective for treating urinary incontinence but may lead to changes in bowel patterns and affects overall quality of life (QoL). Effects on bowel patterns imposed by solifenacin can be positive or negative, therefore, physicians should consider more holistic therapy by addressing overall bowel symptoms when treating OAB patients.",

    "Overall survival and freedom from reoperation after valve-sparing aortic root replacement, even with additional complex cusp repair, provides excellent midterm results. Low risk of valve-related complications and absence of anticoagulation therapy are distinctive advantages of this complex procedure.",
    "The present study shows for the first time a significant association between a marker of inflammation and self-rated health in late adolescent men, adding to evidence of an association between low-grade inflammation and subjective health perception also in men, as previously demonstrated in women. Further support for inflammation as part of a general psychobiological process that underpins subjective health perception is hereby provided.",
    "The findings suggest that while the distribution of categories and severity are not dependent on the sample size, the rate of adverse events is. Further studies are needed to conclude if the optimal sample size may need to be adjusted based on the hospital size in order to detect a more accurate rate of adverse events.",

    "Serum uric acid showed an inverse association with cognitive function among women and the association was amplified by the presence of cardiovascular disease. These results highlight the importance of stratifying by sex and cardiovascular disease in future studies on uric acid and cognition.",
    "Receiving industry contributions greater than $1,000 is associated with greater scholarly impact among academic otolaryngologists. In a smaller surgical specialty, such as otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, direct industry research support-as well as indirect contributions through the support of educational programs, consulting, and other expenses-potentially impacts scholarly discourse; these findings do not reflect a causal relationship and may require further characterization.",
    "-No guidelines exist regarding the reporting of margins in nonmelanoma skin cancer biopsies, and reporting practices vary extensively among pathologists. We found that nearly one-quarter of positive margins in shave biopsies for cutaneous carcinomas are missed on standard histologic examination. Moreover, reporting of a positive margin may also be misleading if the clinician has definitively treated the skin cancer at the time of biopsy. For these reasons, and as routine exhaustion of all tissue blocks is impractical, the decision to include or exclude a comment regarding the margin status should be given conscious consideration, accounting for the clinical intent of the biopsy and any known information regarding postbiopsy treatment.",
    "Because heavier smokers with higher risk of health-related consequences were less sensitive to pricing policy than mild smokers, pricing policy alone is not enough to reduce the societal burden caused by smoking. We suggest that additional cessation policy is needed along with pricing policy for adolescents with heavier smoking behavior in Korea.",
    "This equipment provides a helpful way to encourage guided independent learning through practice and discovery and because each session is case study based and the relationship of the data to the patient is made clear. Our students helped to evaluate our initial use of LabTutor and found the sessions enjoyable and helpful. LabTutor provides an effective learning tool as part of a blended learning strategy for biosciences teaching.",
    "This study represents, to our knowledge, the first longitudinal analysis of systemic neurotoxicity after THA in a large cohort of patients. The results of our study suggest that on the large scale, neurologic side effects previously described do not occur as a common attributable complication. Rather, these cases may be due to individual patient hypersensitivity to metal ions.",
    "Invitations to cervical cancer screening were information poor and biased in favour of participation. This means that informed choice is not possible, which is in conflict with modern requirements for personal involvement in medical decisions.",

    "The INA is wider when OC is prefixed, intermediate when normofixed and narrowed when postfixed. This observation throws light on the possibility of using INA as a marker of RAPL of OC. As INA can be measured in axial MRI sections, it can be used in differentiation of the cases with prefixed OC from others during pre-operative work up for pituitary surgeries and to identify individuals 'at risk' during subfrontal approach for pituitary lesions.",
    "A therapist or computer BI reduced alcohol consumption and consequences among risky drinkers regardless of reason for emergency department presentation highlighting the opportunity to reach a broad array of youth.

    "Although individuals with CD seem to be at an increased risk of overall death after sepsis, that excess risk does not differ from the general excess mortality previously seen in celiac patients in Sweden. CD as such does not seem to influence short-term or sepsis-specific survival in individuals with sepsis and therefore is not an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in sepsis.",
    "Mirabegron markedly relaxed isolated CC strips by activating β3 -adrenoceptors independently of the NO-cGMP pathway. There is also evidence of the existence of a close functional link between β3 -adrenoceptors and the RhoA/ROCK pathway. These results may support further clinical studies using combinations of mirabegron with ROCK and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) for the treatment of ED, especially in patients who do not respond to PDE5i therapy.",
    "Grosser type, tumor subtype, tumor displacement artifact, and characteristics of tumor emboli are pathologic features that affect the interpretation of LVI in testicular GCTs. Pathologists should be aware of these variables to more accurately diagnose LVI.",

    "The improved outcomes reported for other nontrauma conditions in TC were not observed for patients undergoing an emergent colectomy for diverticulitis after accounting for patient, procedure, and hospital-level characteristics. Future research is needed to assess differences in case mix between TC versus NTC and possible case-mix effects on outcomes to elucidate potential benefit of surgical care in a TC across the breadth of emergency general surgery conditions.",
    "In patients with end-stage DCM and secondary MR, the association of the EE technique to the undersized annuloplasty significantly decreases the rate of recurrent MR at long-term. This higher repair durability did not translate into a better long-term prognosis in this series.",
    "Although femur fractures are rare, a component from each of the 3 therapeutic modalities contributes to the overall risk, and a multidisciplinary approach to mitigating fracture risk is needed. Although avoiding circumferential bone coverage with the 50-Gy isodose line may be a valuable dosimetric parameter, more rigorous dosimetric studies are required.",

These data suggest a tenuous funding situation that may be susceptible to future spending cuts. Future research is needed to identify barriers to National Institutes of Health funding procurement in academic plastic surgery.",
    "These findings indicate that greater BMI is an independent risk factor for undergoing a revision procedure following a LD. These findings conflict with recent studies that have found no difference between obese and non-obese patients in regards to risk for recurrent herniation and/or revision procedures. Patients with greater BMI undergoing LD should be informed they could have an elevated risk for revision procedures.",
    "While connectivism provides a useful lens through which teaching and learning using digital technologies can be better understood and managed, further development and testing is required.

    "The findings do not support higher effectiveness of games developed with PD. However, significant differences existed among PD games. More support was found for informant roles than for codesign roles. When PD was applied to game dynamics, levels, and game challenge, this was associated with higher effectiveness than when it was applied to game aesthetics. Since user involvement may have an important influence on reach, adoption, and implementation of the intervention, further research and design efforts are needed to enhance effectiveness of serious games developed with PD.",

    "Frankly invasive CXPA was a high-grade malignancy with an unfavorable prognosis. Elective neck dissection should be performed in cases of frankly invasive CXPA that originate in the submandibular gland. Patients with minimally invasive and noninvasive CXPA should be followed closely after primary treatment because regional or distant metastasis can occur.",

    "Prolonged donor allograft ischemic times were not associated with an adverse effect on survival. The use of allografts with ischemic times through 6 hours achieved acceptable 2-year survival rates after transplantation. The use of donor organs with prolonged ischemic times should prompt the United Network for Organ Sharing to move toward better allocation of donor organs.",
    "The high percentage loss of information was mainly due to the specialist and, secondly, to the route taken and patient.

    "Deficiencies were identified in the quality of malignant melanoma histopathology reports in Trent Region. There is no reason to believe that significant improvements have occurred since 1990 or that other regions are performing differently. A national standard for reporting primary cutaneous malignant melanoma is recommended. As a minimum, all reports should include Breslow thickness and a specific measurement of lateral clearance. This will facilitate prognostic evaluation, clinical management and audit. This standard would not exclude the reporting of other information, depending on local policy. As with all standards, continual review must be undertaken and consideration given as to whether other more recent parameters, such as growth phase, also warrant future inclusion.",
    "Despite consistent encouragement to record all relevant details on death certificates this study shows that doctors fail to do so in most cases. Such a failure diminishes information available to the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, affecting mortality statistics and gives further cause for concern about standards of certification. Means by which the standard of certification might be improved are discussed, including screening of certificates by a medically qualified person prior to registration.",
    "Given the outcomes of this study, the differences observed previously in rapid torque development abilities in healthy older adults, compared with healthy younger adults, seem attributable largely to differences in muscle contraction mechanisms rather than to differences in speeds of stimulus sensing or central processing of motor commands, or to differences in muscle recruitment strategies.",

    "Hypothermic CPB resulted in more pronounced alterations of platelet aggregation and endothelial-related coagulation than normothermic CPB. Plasma levels of soluble thrombomodulin were more increased in hypothermic than in normothermic CPB indicating more extensive endothelial damage or activation associated with hypothermic CPB.",
    "In case of an intrarenal lesion of more than 3 cm in diameter and additional tumor vascularization seen in selective pharmaco-angiography, the kidney undoubtedly can be removed by primary nephrectomy without a preliminary sample excision to confirm the diagnosis. For tumors with a diameter of less than 3 cm and additional tumor-vascularization, the option should be enucleation. If there is a \"tumor\" without typical malignant vascularization, the exploration by sample excision should be performed. Depending on the histological result the tumor should be removed by enucleation or nephrectomy.",

    "Gender differences in hormone responses may be related to differences in peripheral metabolism of ACTH, resulting in changes of immunoreactivity but not bioactivity or a different set point of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The pattern of ACTH and cortisol responses to oCRH and the 24-hour excretion of free cortisol was normal in adolescents with depression, probably reflecting normal negative feedback mechanisms at this age or that most of these patients suffer from atypical rather than melancholic depression.",
    "Glut overexpression was not a common characteristic of the five tumors tested. Iodine-125 HPP-forskolin and [3H]cytochalasin B did not localize in LX-1 tumors, indicating that these agents did not target tumors with upregulated Glut. Results suggest that Glut are not a promising target for tumor imaging.",

    "There was no statistically significant loss of relative renal function in patients treated with partial nephrectomy and no significant gain in relative renal function in those treated with an upper pole salvage procedure. The reoperation rate was higher in the upper pole salvage than in the partial nephrectomy group (25 versus 4%). While not statistically significant, we believe that this rate is clinically important. We think that partial nephrectomy should remain the preferred treatment for most patients with obstructed duplicated kidneys.",

    "We found no evidence for an influence of cCMRO2 on acute-stage neurological deficit or for a role of the unaffected hemisphere in early recovery after acute MCA ischemic stroke. The decline in unaffected-hemisphere metabolism from the acute to the subacute stage in the face of overall clinical recovery appears clinically irrelevant. The fact that the neocortical cCMRO2 at PET2 tended to be lower, and declined significantly from PET1 to PET2 in the mirror region in the subgroup of patients with large infarcts, suggests that this delayed effect represents transcallosal fiber degeneration.",

    "A normal V/Q scan in a single lung, when the contralateral lung was interpreted as non-high-probability for PE, did not completely exclude PE on the apparently normal side. In such lungs, the probability of PE was in the range of low-probability interpretations. If the pulmonary angiogram showed no PE on the side of the abnormal V/Q scan, the probability of PE on the side of the normal V/Q scan satisfied the definition of very low probability for PE. This observation in patients undergoing pulmonary angiography may assist in determining whether the pulmonary angiogram should be bilateral.",

Otherwise, in patients with IC intussusception and no sign of peritoneal irritation, hydrostatic or pneumatic reduction is indicated. When this fails, surgery is the next step. SBIs free of peritoneal irritation and shorter than 2.3 cm tend to spontaneously reduce. For those longer than 4 cm, particularly in patients with history of abdominal surgery, spontaneous reduction is unlikely.",

    "The scaling relationships examined in the current study parallel those seen across species. It is plausible that the explanation of intraspecific scaling relationships, as trait combinations favored by natural selection, is the same as those invoked to explain across species patterns. Thus, it is very likely that the global interspecific Corner's rules and other leaf-leaf scaling relationships emerge as the aggregate of largely parallel intraspecific patterns.",
    "The survival increase in Germany and the survival advantage in the USA might be explained by differences in incidence and stage distributions over time and across countries. Effects of early detection or a lead-time bias due to the more widespread utilisation and earlier introduction of PSA testing in the USA are likely to explain the observed patterns.",

    "As expected, non-TF patients were at a higher risk than TF patients for procedural morbidity and death. Although no differences were observed in 30-day deaths or morbidity in different STS PROM subgroups, those undergoing non-TF TAVR at a higher STS PROM (>8%) had higher 1-year mortality. When applicable, TF TAVR remains the procedure of choice in high- or extreme-risk patients undergoing TAVR.",
    "In this prospective international multi-institution study of 80 femoral hernia repairs, no difference was found for operative times, long-term outcomes, or QOL in the treatment of femoral hernias when comparing laparoscopic vs. open techniques. After repair, QOL at all time-points postoperatively improved compared to QOL scores preoperatively for laparoscopic and open femoral hernia repair. While international data supports improved outcomes with laparoscopic approach for femoral hernia repair, no data had existed prior to this study on the difference of approach impacting QOL. In the setting where recurrence and complication rates are equal after femoral hernia repair for either approach, surgeons should perform the technique with which they are most confident, as the operative approach does not appear to change QOL outcomes after femoral hernia repair.",

    "In this cohort, maternal disclosure of HIV serostatus to family members (other than sexual partner[s]) was associated independently with a reduction in postpartum depression by more than one-half. Disclosure of HIV serostatus to a family member may be a marker for psychosocial well-being and enhanced support that affords protection against postpartum depression.",

    "The complex temporal dynamics of tumor oxygenation combined with probabilistic cell kinetics in the modeling of radiation therapy requires sophisticated stochastic modeling to predict tumor cell kill. For stereotactic ablative radiation therapy, high doses in the first week followed by doses that are more moderate may be beneficial because a high percentage of hypoxic cells could be eradicated early while keeping the required BED10 relatively low and BED3 toxicity to tolerable levels.",

    "Our results suggest that a one year follow-up instead of two years is sufficient for BI-RADS 3 lesions, in case of using rigorous inclusion criteria. Given the very low PPV of the BI-RADS(®) 3 lesions incidentally found on MRI, further studies with very large inclusions are necessary to establish new guidelines for MRI follow-up.",

Grade C fistula developed in 1 patient and was complicated by intraabdominal abscesses and sepsis. Although the patient did not require a repeated surgery, but only a continuation of conservative treatment on an outpatient basis. Patients with grade B fistula required prolonged drainage and in the end were supervised by the surgical polyclinic.",

    "This study, designed as a proof of principle, indicated that the LDT is an accurate, robust and automated assay, which adequately and reliably identifies patients presenting with small fiber neuropathy, and therefore has potential for use in large scale clinical studies.",
    "The use of nasal steroids with oxymetazoline was more effective over 6 weeks than nasal steroids alone in improving blocked nose, hyposmia, nasal mucociliary clearance, and polyp size in treatment of nasal polyposis. There was no evidence of rebound congestion after 4 weeks of oxymetazoline treatment.",
    "Among subfertile women, one-third were overweight or obese, and some had other lifestyle factors with known adverse effects on fertility such as use of tobacco. Overweight and obese women adjusted their habits but did not reduce their body mass index. Women of fertile age would benefit from preconception counseling, and the treatment of infertility should routinely offer interventions for lifestyle changes.",
    "Adjusting for insurance improves statistical models when analyzing readmissions after coronary artery bypass grafting, but does not impact hospital performance ratings substantially. Deciding whether SDS should be included in a patient's risk profile depends on valid measurements of SDS and requires a nuanced approach to assessing how these variables improve risk-adjusted models.",
    "Despite the small number of cell types they contain, nematosomes are distinct among tissues, both functionally and molecularly. We provide the first evidence that nematosomes comprise part of the innate immune system in N. vectensis, and suggest that this tissue is potentially an important place to look for genes associated with pathogen stress. Finally, we demonstrate that Nematostella-specific genes comprise a significant proportion of the differentially expressed genes in all three of the tissues we examined and may play an important role in novel cell functions.",

    "Our results underline the influence of caregivers' cultural stereotypes on the type of care, as well as on their professional behaviors and on older adult functioning. Caregivers' cultural stereotypes could be considered as a central issue in older adult care since they mediate the triangle of care: caregivers/older adults/type of care; therefore, much more attention should be paid to this psychosocial care component.",
    "Postoperative infection and nonunion rates are comparable between LISS and LCP for both open and closed distal femoral fracture fixation. As no difference was detected between plates, either may be used to treat distal femur fractures. Nonunion rate was higher than expected based on previous reports.",
    "We found no evidence of biological differences between interval and screen-detected CRCs, consistent with the low sensitivity of guaiac stool testing as the main driver of interval CRC.

    "The use of CPAP in the immediate post-extubation period after corrective surgery for TEF/EA appears to be safe and may not be associated with increased risk of AL or recurrence of the fistula. Information from other centres, surveys and large databases is needed to define the benefits and risks of use of CPAP in these infants.",

    "Both off- and on-pump procedures produced excellent early clinical results with low mortality. An advantage of an off-pump operation was less postoperative morbidity; however, less complete revascularization introduced uncertainty about late results. A disadvantage of on-pump bypass was higher morbidity that seemed attributable to cardiopulmonary bypass.",
    "Acceptance and disacceptance rates were almost equal after the implementation of multicomponent donation and at the time point when the interview was performed. The majority of donors was highly motivated to donate multicomponents, by these means we were able to increase our RBC supply and to improve standardization of our products.",

    "The proportion of male births declines with increasing gestation, even when time of conception is known. This male excess appears to be strongest for spontaneous preterm births. Studying the sex ratio of preterm births by medical risk factors may clarify why the male excess is absent in some populations. The possibility that obstetric decision-making affects the sex ratio of indicated births must be considered.",

    "Boys with a varicocele are at significant risk for testicular growth arrest, irrespective of varicocele size, and those with a grade 3 varicocele have a higher risk of testicular growth arrest than those with a grade 2 varicocele. Of boys with testes of equal size at diagnosis growth arrest is observed during adolescence in approximately 25% irrespective of varicocele size.",
    "This series represents the largest reported multi-institutional experience with the Snodgrass technique. When used in conjunction with vascularized dartos flap coverage, 2-layer closure of the neourethra and special attention to preservation of the periurethral vascular supply, this repair can be performed with a near 0 complication rate. We believe that this is the optimal repair for routine cases of hypospadias.",
    "Although the controversy between use of grafts and flaps will probably continue forever, we believe that our 2-stage approach should be considered as a valid alternative for the most severe forms of hypospadias. Long-term results appear to outnumber the necessity of a learning curve for appropriate graft manipulation.",

    "Working longer hours during school is associated with cigarette use, particularly among young teenagers. Although these cross-sectional data prohibit any firm conclusions regarding causality, the strong association observed among young teenagers increases the plausibility of early work transition being a risk factor for initiating smoking.",
    "Penetrating injuries are uncommon, but cause serious injury in children. There are two clear groups: (i) those dead at the scene or moribund on arrival, in whom prevention must be the main aim; and (ii) those with stable vital signs.

    "Although in most patients the esophagus is uniformly hypersensitive, in some either the smooth muscle or the striated muscle segment can be hypersensitive. If considering balloon distention at only one level, we recommend balloon placement at 10 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter because of a higher yield of hypersensitivity.",
    "The prescription of cotrimoxazole by both DDs and NDDs was widely irrational. They prescribed cotrimoxazole too frequently, and DDs used subcurative doses to a wider extent. By this prescribing practice, both groups, but especially the DDs, contribute to increasing health hazards, cost and risk of developing bacterial resistance. The method for assessing rationality of drug prescribing was found feasible, and it is recommended that it be further tested and developed.",
    "Propofol in a small dose (0.8 mg.kg-1 body weight) was a useful drug to relieve laryngeal spasm in most children (76.9%) following the removal of the LMA. Because it was not found to be effective in all patients, succinylcholine still has a role to play in critical conditions. However, we recommend propofol as a suitable alternative for relieving laryngeal spasm in situations where succinylcholine is contraindicated.",

However, eight patients failed to respond to the treatment, despite histological evidence of a well differentiated tumour according to the new classification. This suggests that further histological examination should be carried out, especially in patients with visceral metastases and a short disease-free interval.",
    "Chronically impaired autonomic function may link social position to different components of coronary risk in the general population.",

    "Intense PRT with adequate volume seems to be an effective and safe intervention for stimulating muscle growth in patients with RA. Pending confirmation of these results in a larger randomized controlled trial that includes patients with more active and severe disease, a similar PRT program should be included in the management of RA as adjunct treatment for cachexia.",

Publication and dissemination of the results of the previous surveys may have been associated with these improvements and similar recurrent service review may be applicable to services for other chronic childhood conditions.",
    "In this study the DAS28 cut off point for the ARA remission was lower than in previous studies. The cut off point for DAS28 remission remains controversial. A substantial proportion of patients below the DAS28 cut off point for remission have tender or swollen joints, or both. DAS28 may not be an appropriate tool for assessment of remission in RA.",

    "The RV wall motion is nonuniform in contour area change, strain, and timing of motion. Patients with RVOT ventricular ectopy demonstrate wall motion parameters similar to those of normal subjects. This technique should be applicable in analyzing RV wall motion in patients suspected of having ARVC/D.",

    "An ingestion of more than 6 cigarettes is considered a life-threatening intoxication for adult persons. In spite of the ingestion of 7 up to 20 cigarettes our patient never showed any symptoms of a severe or life-threatening nicotine intoxication. In the last decades no lethal nicotine intoxication after ingestion of cigarettes in adults was published in the literature.",
    "In a double-injury rat model, NIH can be inhibited by short-term systemic rapamycin, but suppression of early cell migration and proliferation is pivotal. A limited peri-interventional antiproliferative therapy may be of value as an adjunct to control restenosis after balloon angioplasty and/or stenting.",
    "PAD patients with higher levels of leg pain or a greater comorbidity burden generally have more pronounced QoL impairment. They can gain considerable QoL benefits from percutaneous procedures, especially if they have greater QoL impairment initially, and experience substantial improvements in exertional leg pain after treatment. In general, neither age nor comorbidity should negatively influence the decision for percutaneous therapy in symptomatic PAD patients.",
    "With the management of 76.4% of patients unchanged following biopsy, some may argue that these patients underwent unnecessary surgery. However, TAB is a minor procedure that can yield important results for the management of GCA, which if untreated can lead to serious complications. We believe TAB should be performed where there is clinical suspicion of GCA.",

    "Though the idea of primary anastomosis with on table lavage for left sided anastomosis seems attractive, we think the Hartmann procedure is still useful for selected patients.",
    "The positive association between breastfeeding and IGF-I could be due to residual confounding or to chance. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the fully adjusted effect estimate and the novelty of the association suggest that larger studies should now be conducted to confirm or refute the hypothesis that variations in IGF-I by infant feeding mode explain associations of breastfeeding with health in later life.",
    "The potential of PS38 to cause severe disease is documented in this report. Current literature does not support the hypothesis that this serotype is increasing in incidence. However, as we monitor the changing epidemiology of pneumococcal illness in the US in this conjugate era, PS38 might find a more prominent and concerning niche as a replacement serotype.",
    "Simple hysterectomy appears to be a suitable diagnostic and treatment option for women with recurrent high-grade cytological abnormalities where further loop treatment is technically not possible. Incomplete excision at the endocervical margin on the previous loop specimen was the main factor associated with the presence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at hysterectomy.",
    "Several clinical variables are associated with the presence of visible debris captured by distal filter devices. The current study failed to identify any variables capable of consistently predicting the absence of visible debris. These findings support the routine rather than the selective use of cerebral protection during CAS.",
    "Before initiation of hemodialysis, an unexpectedly high prevalence of critical stenoses was found in patent pAVFs using CDU surveillance. These de novo stenoses appear to develop rapidly after arterialization of the upper extremity superficial veins and can be reliably detected by CDU surveillance. Turbulent flow conditions in pAVFs may play a role in inducing progressive vein wall and valve leaflet intimal thickening, although stenoses may be due to venous abnormalities that predate AVF placement. Routine CDU surveillance of pAVFs should be considered to identify and correct flow-limiting stenoses that may compromise pAVF long-term patency and use.",
    "Some criminal offences could be prevented if more time and effort were spent in general psychiatric practice in identifying patients at high risk for violence and in reducing symptoms of psychoses before discharge.",
    "Spinal tumors in cases involving NF2 are heterogeneous in type, distribution, and behavior but larger-size tumors are more likely to progress significantly. Intramedullary tumors usually accompany multiple extramedullary tumors. In the authors' experience subtyping of the NF2 mutation has not yet influenced management. Protein-truncating mutations are associated with an increased prevalence of spinal tumors.",
    "Isolated cases of PCT can be induced through the effect of various hepatotoxic factors. However, the influence of common porphyrinogenically acting noxious substances (alcohol, HCV virus or iron overload as a result of the HFE gene mutations) were not found in our patients.",

    "Health education is an important factor in the process of health promotion, and health professionals should consider the dynamics of a specific group in order to carry out their work effectively. Awareness of the special characteristics of an individual as a member of a defined group can contribute to increasing the motivation for participation in health programs as a member of that group. It is suggested that more educational programs take place in rural Crete in order to augment the compliance rate of women in cervical screening programs.",
    "Evaluation from these two RCS has shown that short rotations are likely to be less optimal than longer rotations for meeting the broader goals of the RCS to build future workforce capacity. Our results suggest that one opportunity to acculturate students into the rural lifestyle is lost when students' placements are insufficiently long for them to put down roots in their community, and to understand how to 'live' there more broadly. Good rural experiences and teaching and learning opportunities are not sufficient in themselves. Students' emotional attachment to rural living comes from experience related to time and the connection to local people that comes as a result of time spent in the community. Students on short rotations do not make that local connection.",

The ovine incisor model presents opportunities to investigate irrigation regimes under controlled ex-vivo conditions. 2.NaOCl (5%) remains the most effective irrigant for rapid debris removal in immature root canals. 3. Carisolv cleans pulp debris from the walls of immature root canals as effectively as NaOCl (1%) during static, unrefreshed wall contact for between 20 and 30 min. 4. Refreshment of NaOCl (1%) enhances its cleaning ability above that of Carisolv.",

    "Prolongation of the administration interval may be the preferable dose adjustment method in renal failure with ciprofloxacin. We hypothesize that these results may be transferable to other so-called dose-dependent antimicrobial drugs.",
    "RLP levels predicted CHD incidence independently of nonlipid risk factors and of total cholesterol or high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, RLP levels did not provide additional information about CHD incidence over and above total triglyceride levels. Therefore, this study does not support the need for testing of remnants in men if measures of fasting triglycerides are available.",
    ": Men with ED were more likely to have hypertension than men without ED. This evidence supports the hypothesis that ED shares common risk factors with hypertension. It also suggests that men with ED and clinicians could use ED as an alerting signal to detect and treat undiagnosed hypertension earlier.",
    "Large individual variation was seen, and, by definition, the precision was poor when estimating MW for individuals. In practical terms, the prediction error may span multiple weight classes, thus making leg-to-leg BIA unacceptable for prediction of MW in this sample under the conditions of the study.",
    "Demographic profile and breast cancer risk factors have little effect on self-reported use of diagnostic procedures following an abnormal mammography examination. Level of mammography abnormality determines diagnostic evaluation but variance by site of care was observed.",

    "The grade of trainee seems to make little difference with regard to ability to prioritize referrals, but within grades there is little agreement on what constitutes an urgent referral. We suggest further research, looking at the final outcome of patients, needs to be done to try to establish evidence-based guidelines to assist with letter vetting.",
    "Kir6.2 is essential for the function of K(ATP) channel in mouse atrial cells. Given that Kir6.2 KO mice are susceptible to stretch-induced secretion of ANP, our results suggest that K(ATP) channels may act as a negative feedback mechanism for the control of ANP secretion.",
    "Vitamin/mineral supplementation is associated with better survival and quality of life in this cohort of NSCLC patients. Future prospective clinical trials should focus on the role of such supplements in patients with NSCLC.",
    "Brain metastases are common in patients with LA-NSCLC treated with CMT. These patients may benefit from either prophylactic cranial irradiation or early detection and aggressive treatment of brain metastases.",

    "Lung transplantation appears to yield significant HRQoL benefits for patients. Many patients do, however, experience frequent symptoms associated with immunosuppression that may limit the full benefit of transplantation, and some of these symptoms appear to worsen over time. Future research efforts should focus on the development, implementation and evaluation of clinical interventions designed to optimize HRQoL both before and after lung transplantation.",

    "The medical data interpretation test is a reliable and valid measure of the ability to interpret medical statistics.",
    "Predental antibiotic prophylaxis is cost-effective only for persons with moderate or high risk of developing endocarditis. Contrary to current recommendations, our data demonstrate that amoxicillin and ampicillin are not cost-effective and should not be considered the agents of choice. Clarithromycin should be considered the drug of choice and cephalexin as an alternative drug of choice. The current published guidelines and recommendations should be revised.",
    "Hypersensitive dyspeptic patients reach the same intensity of painful and non-painful sensations as normosensitive patients but at lower distending pressures. Hyperalgesia occurs in hypersensitive dyspeptic patients at distending pressures that also induce intense non-painful sensations. These findings argue against isolated upregulation of pain specific afferents in functional dyspepsia patients with visceral hypersensitivity.",
    "The results suggest that altered postural adjustments of the trunk muscles during pain are not caused by pain interference but are likely to reflect development and adoption of an alternate postural adjustment strategy, which may serve to limit the amplitude and velocity of trunk excursion caused by arm movement.",
    "This finding contrasts with studies of other injuries, suggesting that occupation does not fully account for variations in eye injury risk. Because protective eye-wear can prevent most serious eye injuries, we hypothesize that differences in protective eye-wear use between men and women may contribute to differences in eye injury rates, although follow-up studies are needed to confirm this. Prevention efforts should consider targeting high-risk demographic groups in addition to high-risk occupations.",
    "Our findings seem to show that the periodicity of stimulation does not effect the results of PTNS treatment. The advantage of more frequent stimulation sessions is to achieve earlier a clinical improvement.",
    "The main reason of the decrease of occupational accidents was probably due to unreported accidents, which do not cause injury. Reasons for underreporting of minor accidents should be investigated and this point should be taken into consideration when planning an occupational accident prevention programs.",
    "Dengue is common among febrile diseases of childhood, with prevalence that varies according to the epidemiological situation. The clinical status of children with dengue was very similar to that of children with other nonspecific diseases. The Health Ministry criteria for suspected cases was shown to be of little use, particularly with smaller children and during periods of reduced incidence.",
    "Contrary to what was expected, no change was observed in physicians' ability to detect distress in patients with cancer after a communication skills training programs, regardless of whether physicians attended the basic training program or the basic training program followed by the consolidation workshops. The results indicated a need for further improvements in physicians' detection skills through specific training modules, including theoretical information about factors that interfere with physicians' detection and through role-playing exercises that focus on assessment and supportive skills that facilitate detection.",

    "The study largely confirmed the expectation that the increase in cannabis use from 1988 to 1996 was paralleled by a decrease in the age of first cannabis use. From 1996 to 2003 age of first cannabis use and prevalence stabilized, possibly occasioned by a change in cannabis policy in the mid-1990s.",
    "Cough episodes meeting a clinical case definition for pertussis commonly used in surveillance are reported by a high proportion of carers of school-aged children in Australia. The majority of children who met the CDC and Australian case definitions for pertussis and sought medical attention were not identified as potentially having pertussis, suggesting underdiagnosis of pertussis. Even if less than half of this is true pertussis, the potential impact in terms of transmission of pertussis in the community is likely to be high. The reported incidence of doctor-diagnosed disease estimated from this survey was at least five and up to 20 times the official notification rate. More work needs to be done in raising awareness among medical practitioners of pertussis as a differential diagnosis in older children and adolescents with cough.",
    "Obesity appears to be an independent risk factor for renal failure. Targeting obesity is beneficial not only for better control of hypertension and diabetes, but also possibly helps stabilization of chronic kidney failure.",
    "this study confirms a high prevalence of malnutrition risk in hospitalised elderly patients. The health care and social welfare system appeared to be unaware of the problem. Poor quality of life in females and loss of the health of a spouse were related to malnutrition risk. The screening variables that were used appeared not to predict hospital length of stay or discharge destination.",
    "Owing to the reported difficulties of integrating more time-consuming alcohol interventions in emergency departments, it is suggested that at least screening for drinking should be implemented as routine in emergency departments. More research is needed in order to establish the optimal balance between effective alcohol intervention, and acceptable time and effort requirement from staff.",

It is suggested that alcohol consumption may play a role in reducing the risk of stroke by modifying the physiological or psychological stress response.",
    "The comparable outcome is likely due to cardioprotection provided by both IAC bypass surgery and hypothermia, which might obscure beneficial effects of pharmacological preconditioning in patients with good left ventricular function (ejection fraction>50%). As the benefit might have been marginal, it may well become apparent in a larger study on patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction.",

    "Our findings suggest that allergy-related choice of bedding is an important factor in the assessment of the relation between synthetic bedding and asthma symptoms. Ignoring those changes can lead to false-positive risk estimates. Prospective studies that allow to disentangle the temporal sequence of disease, exposure, and change of bedding should help to further clarify this issue.",

However, allowing clinicians to choose from a number of treatment techniques does not appear to have improved the outcomes of these RCTs that have investigated the effect of manual therapy for NSLBP. If tailoring manual therapy treatment to NSLBP patients does positively impact on patient outcomes, this is not yet systematically apparent.",
    "The rate of incidentally detected PC by TURP decreases over time, but in almost all cases we found clinically relevant cancer. TURP is not an adverse prognostic factor and morbidity is similar compared with patients who were diagnosed by needle biopsy.

    "In this study 5-FU did not provoke an intraocular inflammatory response and had minimal effect on extraocular structures. Changes in corneal epithelium and endothelium detectable by confocal microscopy suggest a small toxic effect. These in vivo measurements by confocal microscopy were confirmed by SEM. Repeated administration did not cause additional cumulative toxic effects in the anterior segment. Therefore, multiple injections of 5- FU into the filtering bleb pose minimal risk to intraocular structures.",

Implications for Rehabilitation Anorexia Nervosa Restricting Type (AN-R) AN-R is a psychiatric disorder that has a major impact on muscle mass content and function. However, little or no attention has been paid to muscle recovery. High intensity resistance training is safe for AN-R after hospitalization and enhances the force generating capacity as well as muscle mass gains. Skeletal muscle mass content and muscular function improvements are partially maintained for a short period of time when the exercise program ceases.",

    "This study revealed that SLC22A11 and ABCC1 may be important to identify those patients who will not benefit from MTX treatment, highlighting the relevance in translating these results to clinical practice. However, further validation by independent studies is needed to develop the field of personalized medicine to predict clinical response to MTX treatment.",
    "Across diverse critical care topics, propensity score studies published in high-impact journals produced results that were generally consistent with the findings of randomized clinical trials. However, caution is needed when interpreting propensity score studies because occasionally their results contradict those of randomized clinical trials and there is no reliable way to predict disagreements.",
    "We conclude that the participants' satisfaction with the offered learning approach changed over time. The lacking match between these learning style preferences and the learning approach in the educational components of the quality improvement collaboratives studied might be the reason why the participants felt they did not gain new insights and therefore ceased their participation in the collaborative. This study provides guidance for future organisers and participants of quality improvement collaboratives about which learning approaches will best suit the participants and enhance improvement work.",

These findings suggest that PA in adolescence might decrease ADHD symptoms in early adulthood. However, given the size of the effect, the clinical value of this intervention needs to be explored further.",
    "The decision to operate for an abdominal emergency in the setting of disseminated cancer is difficult. Our study confirms the high risk for morbidity and mortality in this population. Preoperative factors including sepsis, increased ASA class, low serum albumin level, and patient functional dependence all predict poor outcomes.",
    "OSAS patients have lower nesfatin-1 levels compared to controls, and a greater nesfatin-1 deficit corresponds to an increased severity of OSAS and an increased neck circumference. Replacement therapy may be a potential treatment for obese OSAS patients who have lower nesfatin-1 levels, which may have additional benefits through appetite suppression and weight loss.",

    "The majority of respondents preferred ERCP for the management of CDL. Having a reliable ERCP proceduralist available, use of selective IOC, and metropolitan status were independently associated with preoperative ERCP. Postoperative ERCP was preferred for managing intraoperatively discovered CDL. Many surgeons are uncomfortable performing LCBDE, and increased training may be needed.",
    "Among 63 pediatric CI candidates, absent responses to high-intensity ASSR was the major finding (specificity>90%) predicting behavioral thresholds in the profound hearing loss range. These findings can be helpful to confirm the decision for cochlear implantation.",

    "VEP habituation with 16' checks did not differ in migraineurs and controls. This is in agreement with previous findings with other stimulation parameters. It is therefore unlikely that use of different stimulation parameters could explain the discrepant results of previous studies. No studies that applied blinding during recording of VEP have found lack of habituation in migraineurs.",
    "At our centre, lower mini-sternotomy represents a safe alternative for the repair of congenital heart defects in paediatric and adult populations. Cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times were longer in the mini-sternotomy group. However, these patients showed earlier extubation and less postoperative complications when compared with patients with a full sternotomy approach. Combined with improved cosmetic outcomes, lower mini-sternotomy could represent the technique of choice for these populations.",
    "Presentation of urachal remnants is variable but surgical outcomes remain excellent in our experience. When symptoms occur, the surgical decision is easy, but when the diagnosis is incidental, the decision is much more complicated. Official guidelines could ease the decision process and the management of urachal anomalies.",

    "The PSM was found to be performing well in terms of forecasting and procurement of MDR-TB drugs, but there were shortcomings in drug distribution, reporting at treatment centre level and in drug order placements. Despite these gaps, there were no stock outs. These findings indicate that where it matters most, namely ensuring that no drug stock outs affect patient management, the PSM system is effective. Addressing the observed shortcomings will help to strengthen the existing PSM system in anticipation of a growing MDR-TB case burden in the country.",
    "Victims of bullying show a substantial risk for engaging in self-harm behavior. Therefore, the dissemination of anti-bullying programs in schools would probably also prevent such disorders.

    "Extraluminal contrast was seen on CTC in most cases of SBP, but some patients with sealed bladder perforation had only pneumoperitoneum or moderate/large ascites. Therefore, SBP should be suspected in any patient with moderate/large volumes of pelvic fluid or unexplained pneumoperitoneum, even when there is no evidence of contrast extravasation. Patients with no ascites, or small volumes, are unlikely to have SBP; therefore, US can be used to screen low risk patients.",

    "Cementing the metaphyseal stem improves long-term implant survival and does not alter long-term pain relief or the radiographic appearance of the proximal femur as had been a concern based on the results of finite element studies. We believe that patients with small component sizes and large femoral head defects have more to gain from the use of this technique which adds surface area for fixation, and there is no clinical downside to cementing the stem in patients with large component sizes.",
    "Our study results showed an overall infection control rate of 93% and good clinical results using our one-stage approach, which combines aggressive débridement of the collateral ligaments and posterior capsule with a rotating hinge implant. These results are comparable with two-stage techniques at a followup of 10 years; further research into one-stage exchange techniques for PJI in TKA appears warranted.",
    "Further research is required to improve the validity of the SAVE, which may include a simpler web-based survey format or a face-to-face format to facilitate more informed responses. A validated method for estimating equivalent SAVEs is unlikely to replace the QALY as the globally preferred measure of outcome, but the SAVE may provide a useful alternative for localized decision makers with relatively small, constrained budgets-for example, in programme budgeting and marginal analysis.",
    "Some inflammatory markers and indicators of endothelial dysfunction are increased in varicose vein blood. This is most probably the consequence of deteriorated blood flow in dilated and tortuous superficial veins, and increased venous pressure. Damage to the venous wall, which causes a chronic inflammatory response, together with the procoagulant properties of local blood may promote further progression of the disease and thrombotic complications.",
    "More than one-third of medical students who received scholarships in cardiothoracic surgery maintained their interest over time, and more than half maintained interest in a surgical field. Although long-term data are scarce, it remains critical to foster mentoring relationships with students over time to guide their career choices.",

    "Although our study group consists of a selected group of radiation oncology applicants, their grades in radiation oncology clerkships were highly skewed toward the highest grades when compared with grades in other core clerkships. Student grading in radiation oncology clerkships should be re-evaluated to incorporate more objective and detailed performance metrics to allow for meaningful feedback to trainees and to better evaluate residency applicants to radiation oncology.",
    "The health status of participants at baseline seems to have little impact on the external and internal validity of the follow-up assessment in prospective survey research. Hence, the findings provide little support to the HWE as a potential bias in prospective studies within occupational health research. A limitation of the study is that the findings do not inform about the impact of the HWE on participation in the baseline assessment.",
    "Our study provides evidence supporting the value of the RAMQ administrative database for conducting research on certain types of chronic pain disorders including back and neck pain.

Further studies are needed, especially concerning the relationship between sperm origin and late morphokinetic parameters, such as blastocyst development.",
    "The catheter rupture and intracardiac embolization is a rare complication associated with totally implantable or tunneled central venous catheters. When such an event happens, the patient should be managed by expert hemodynamists or interventional radiologists making an effort to remove the fragment without surgical measures. When the intravascular percutaneous route fails, the possibility to leave the fragmented catheter in heart chambers should be evaluated, being surgery questionable in asymptomatic patients.",

However, apart the metal-UHMWE group, all other groups had a steady-state penetration rate well below the osteolysis threshold with a low difference between groups that might not be clinically important at this point. Longer-term followup is needed to warrant whether wear reduction will generate less occurrence of osteolysis and aseptic loosening.",

It may be suitable for those fractures with minimal translation (<4mm), where the superiority of surgery, itself, over external immobilization is questionable. C2-3 fusion is preferable for those fractures with translation>4mm as these are unstable and C2 pedicle screws alone are likely to have less desirable results.",
    "Neither zolpidem nor benzodiazepine was associated with increased risk of all-site fractures in this case cross-over study after adjusting for medications or comorbidities in elderly individuals with insomnia.

    "With the use of this model, the 10 mg/kg dose does not reach the plasma concentration value for antipyresis (10-20 μg/mL), whereas 15 mg/kg is adequate only if assuming a greater absorption constant. The 160 mg dose is effective only for children weighing 10.9 kg. Individual differences in drug bioavailability, volume of distribution, and absorption/elimination constants undoubtedly exist, and future studies directly measuring plasma APAP concentration and pharmacokinetics are needed. However, these results indicate that dosages for APAP in children should be weight based and manufacturers should review their dosing recommendations.",

Nevertheless, holding single or multiple social roles was commonly associated with reduced alcohol use, although not always significantly so. In western European countries, the engagement in adult social roles is postponed to later ages.",
    "In this series, flow diversion for the treatment of MCAAs was safe, was effective in the treatment of fusiform MCAAs, and was not as effective at mid-term for MCA bifurcation aneurysms. Unsatisfactory occlusion rate in bifurcation aneurysms likely results from residual filling of the aneurysms in cases in which the jailed side branch remains patent.",

    "This study has shown that patients may benefit from arthroscopic repair of FAI and labral tears regardless of ACs. The level of improvement, however, is not constant across patients with different characteristics. Moreover, it appears that age may impact perceived improvement after hip arthroscopy. Hip arthroscopy as an intervention in patients with ACs provided positive outcomes, corroborating that an AC is not a contraindication for this procedure.",
    "Hospitalized persons with MCC including serious mental illness enrolled in a medical home were more likely to receive timely outpatient follow-up with a primary care provider but not with a mental health specialist. These findings suggest that the medical home model may be more adept at linking patients to providers in primary care rather than to specialty mental health providers.",
    "A nurse call system that allows nurses to discern the reason behind a nurse call allows them to make a more accurate decision and relieves stress. In particular, the information communicated would reduce uncertainty and lessen nurses' dependence on other factors in their decision. The design of such a system should, however, carefully consider the needs of the department in which it is deployed.",
    "Education to reduce potentially irritating beverages resulted in improvement in LUTS. However, eliminating potentially irritating beverages was difficult to achieve and maintain. Study findings do not allow us to determine whether LUTS improvement was attributable to intake of fewer potentially irritating beverages, reduced intake of all beverages, the effect of self-monitoring, or some combination of these factors.",
    "Based on our study, it can be concluded that CKD prevalence evaluated according to the classification of 2002 seems to be overestimated, and the main factor contributing to a false CKD diagnosis is a physiological decline in eGFR values with aging. The modification of CKD classification carried out by NKF in 2012 requires further observation and evaluation of its usefulness in daily clinical practice.",
    "We postulate that some of the cases of small bowel obstruction with an obvious transition point in long-term peritoneal dialysis patients may represent a unique and localized form of EPS. We aim to emphasize the presence of macroscopic variations in presentation of EPS.",
    "Overall, the survey clearly showed that the knowledge of hospital gynecologists about the effects of age on woman's fertility and ART effectiveness is largely insufficient to offer scientifically correct, helpful information to patients. Properly targeted corrections to academic and periodical educational programs for Ob/Gyn specialists are warranted.",
    "HFNC therapy may have a role in the paediatric ED as an easily administered and well tolerated form of non-invasive respiratory support, but about one-third of patients required escalation to a higher level of respiratory support. Further studies should assess the safety profile of HFNC in larger series, and define the role of HFNC in key respiratory conditions compared with other possible interventions.",
    "The use of Tm:YAG in continuous mode with power settings up to 40 W and flow rates similar to those used in the clinical practice seemed to result in temperature increases in the irrigation fluid, which do not represent a risk for the renal tissue during the UT endoscopic surgery.",
    "We found that in the hands of surgeons comfortable with both approaches, there were few important differences between arthroscopic double-row suture anchor fixation and ORIF for isolated displaced greater tuberosity fractures. Future, larger studies with consistent indications should be performed to compare these treatments; our data can help inform sample-size calculations for such studies.",
    "Reconstruction of defects after resection of giant cell tumor of the distal radius with autogenous structural iliac crest bone graft is a facile technique that can be used to achieve favorable functional results with complications and recurrences comparable to those of other reported techniques. We cannot show that this technique is superior to other options, but it seems to be a reasonable option to consider when other reconstruction options such as allografts are not available.",

    "This study is first to report on public adherence to boil water advisory recommendations in Canada. The findings raise public health concerns, particularly given the high number of BWAs issued each year. Further studies in partnership with community stakeholders and government decision-makers responsible for overseeing public water systems are needed to assess the perceptions of BWAs, the reasons for non-adherence, and to identify information dissemination methods to increase information uptake and public adherence with acceptable uses of public drinking water during a BWA.",

    "In this large observational study, increasing PRU was associated with a monotonic increase in stent thrombosis, whereas bleeding risk was confined to the lowest PRU quintile, suggesting an optimal therapeutic window of platelet inhibition at moderately inhibited PRU. However, there was no demonstrable threshold effect for PRU and mortality in adjusted analyses, perhaps due to the offsetting impact of bleeding and ischemia across the spectrum of platelet inhibition.

    "The expression of the selected widely used cell type markers in primary and immortalized MEC cells did not allow a clear preference between these two cell models for in vitro analyses studying aspects of milk composition. All tested cell models exhibited to a variable degree epithelial and mesenchymal features. Thus, based on their characterization with widely used cell markers, none of these cultures represent an unequivocal alveolar mammary epithelial cell model. For choosing the appropriate in vitro model additional properties such as the expression profile of specific proteins of interest (e.g., transporter proteins) should equally be taken into account.",
    "Arthroscopic MAT without bone plugs improved knee function and reduced pain, allowing sport resumption in 74% of patients and return to the preinjury activity level in 49% of patients at midterm follow-up.

Therefore, clinicians are to consider metastatic prostate cancer as a differential diagnosis for patients with osteolytic bone lesions.",
    "On the basis of the chosen WC cut-offs the prevalence of abdominal obesity varies widely, because percentile-charts are strongly influenced by the population status in a particular moment. A further rate of variability may lay on the site of WC measurement and on the statistical method used to calculate WC cut-offs. Risk-weighted WC cut-offs measured in a standardized anatomic site and calculated by the appropriate method are needed to simply identify by WC measurement those children at high risk of cardio-metabolic complications to whom specific and prompt health interventions should be addressed.",

    "The direction, by a senior clinician, of the requesting of blood tests by junior doctors to ensure that requests were based on clinical need, reduced the number of inappropriate blood tests and resulted in some reduction in laboratory costs.",
    "Techniques that commit to urethral plate transection are criticized because they preclude using the urethral plate. In our study presence of SSS was predictive for the need to transect the plate. Obviously one can decide to keep the urethral plate at all cost, and mobilize it more than we did, or accept more residual curvature, but in reality our aim was to determine a preoperative marker allowing us to define a patient category. We believe presence of SSS is a marker of severity, and that this \"severity\" translates into \"a less usable urethra\". As recent studies caution us about the evolution of the reconstructed native urethra and the possibility that it may not grow as well as the other penile tissues, we believe this extra information could influence the surgeon's decision as to the most appropriate technique for each patient.",

    "The current diagnostic and therapeutic protocols allow obtaining satisfactory clinical outcomes in majority of cases but a high number of major and minor unpredictable complications persist yet. In this series, low compliance, obesity, and extensive soft elbow tissue damage caused by high-energy trauma represented negative prognostic factors unrelated to surgery. On the other hand, the strict application of current algorithms by an expert elbow surgeon appears to improve clinical results by reducing the influence of other avoidable negative prognostic factors well known in current literature, such as the incomplete recognition of injuries, delayed treatment, inadequate treatment of bony and ligamentous injuries, prolonged immobilization and, last but not least, the surgeon's inexperience.",
    "This RCT did not show a significant protective effect of pancrelipase replacement therapy over conventional pancreatic enzyme supplementation on NAFLD development after pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer.

    "SVV decreased after continuous administration of a β1-adrenergic blocker, probably because of a decrease in the difference of maximum stroke volume (SV) and minimum SV, or the downward shift of the Frank-Starling curve that occurred after landiolol administration. We believe that SVV values might be overestimated or misinterpreted when HR is decreased by landiolol and might not necessarily indicate that the patient is hypervolemic or normovolemic.",

    "Adoption of CTPA appears to be associated with an increase in the diagnosis of PE after TJA and an associated decrease in case-fatality. Although CTPA may improve our ability to diagnose PE and possibly reduce mortality, the observed decrease in case-fatality could also be explained by the overdiagnosis of clinically unimportant emboli. The diagnosis of PE was strongly associated with potential iatrogenic harm from anticoagulation and increased length of stay and hospital charges in this study, emphasizing the importance of further investigation to define the role of CTPA in the diagnosis and treatment of PE after TJA.",

This is the first study that documents the advantage of the paramedian approach for dental complications.",
    "This study showed a strong positive relationship between bilateral and unilateral stance Q angles which could be represented in a positive linear regression equation. The linear regression equation was then used to predict the effect on the Q angle of moving from a bilateral to a unilateral stance. It has been found previously that patients with patellofemoral joint pain on loading the limb in unilateral stance in activities such as walking and stair descent have increased knee valgus angle. The current study supports those findings indicating that when taking up unilateral stance patients with patellofemoral joint pain demonstrate greater than expected increase in Q angle which could increase loading on the patellofemoral joint.",

    "Multiparity caused morphometric changes in pubococcygeus muscle but not in bulbospongiosus muscle. As OR expression was high for both muscles, some properties related to fibre composition or muscle physiology could be affected. The finding that serum oestradiol was not elevated at the end of the fourth pregnancy could be related to changes in pelvic and perineal muscles associated with multiparity.",

Further research with larger sample sizes and power is needed to determine if this effect is statistically significant.",
    "Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of death or HF within 30 days of an acute coronary syndrome. However, we did not find any excess risk of death or HF associated with use of K(ATP) channel inhibitors at the time of an acute coronary syndrome, raising doubts about the hypothesis that sulphonylureas inhibit the cardioprotective effects of myocardial K(ATP) channels.",
    "The distribution patterns of alcohol consumption in African countries are consistent with those observed previously in industrialized countries. These findings seem to counter Skog's theory of collective drinking behaviour and support the universality of the observation that the prevalence of problem drinking is linked closely to mean consumption.",

    "Lymphoepithelial cysts of the pancreas are rare and are characteristically seen in men. While a hypodense mass (less than 20 HU) with papillary projections should be considered suspicious for lymphoepithelial cyst, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made solely based on preoperative imaging. EUS-guided biopsy coupled with biochemical/tumor marker studies are increasingly being used as a diagnostic tool to help differentiate between the various types of cystic pancreatic neoplasms. Imaging findings of lymphoepithelial cysts are non-specific and hence surgical resection is often required to rule out the presence of a malignant or pre-malignant cystic pancreatic lesion. In true lymphoepithelial cysts, malignant transformation is not seen and patients who have these cysts are not at increased risk of developing a pancreatic malignancy.",

    "CBI patients perceived better quality of care, while objectively receiving worse quality of care, compared to patients who were not enrolled in CBI. Systematic differences in quality of care expectations between CBI enrollees and non-enrollees may explain this finding. One factor influencing quality of care may be the type of provider payment used by the CBI scheme, which has been identified as a leading factor in reducing provider motivation to deliver high quality care to CBI enrollees in previous studies. Based on this study, it is unlikely that perceived quality of care and patient satisfaction explain the low CBI enrollment rates in this community.",

The presence of 3 or more dystrophic features was highly predictive of the need for surgery, with the most significant individual predictors being vertebral scalloping and dural ectasia. A combination of radiographical and MRI features can be used to predict need for spinal surgery.",
    "This study concludes that use of cross-links in clinical practice may be avoidable. The derivations from biomechanical studies do not translate into clinical advantages. Eliminating the usage of cross-links reduces the operative time as well as the overall total hospital costs (a single cross-link may cost anywhere between $1500 and $2000 and surgeons tend to use single or multiple cross-links). Additionally, prominence of implants, corrosion, infection, implant failure, and pseudarthrosis are the other complications attributed to cross-links in the literature that can be eliminated by preventing their incorporation in spinal constructs.",

    "The uptake of chlamydia testing rose during the campaign; however, this apparent increase was not maintained once overall trends in testing were taken into account. Nonetheless, once secular and cyclical trends were controlled for, the campaign was associated with an increased positivity linked to increased testing of high risk individuals groups in the target population who were previously less likely to come forward for testing. However, our study indicated that there may have been a disparity in the impact of the campaign on different population groups. The content and delivery of ongoing and future information campaigns aimed at increasing chlamydia screening should be carefully developed so that they are relevant to all sections of the target population.",

    "Applying relevant modifications to national quality measure definitions captured a substantial number of additional services. Strict adherence to measure definitions might miss the true quality of care provided, especially among populations that may have sporadic patterns of care utilization.",
    "Increased efforts are needed to reduce the incidence of occupational contact dermatitis in hairdressers in Australia, and to ensure that hairdressers with occupational contact dermatitis are aware of their compensation entitlements. Reliance on workers' compensation data for disease surveillance may lead occupational health and safety regulators to underestimate the magnitude of the problem of occupational contact dermatitis in the hairdressing profession.",
    "Among hospices with higher proportions of AAs, family members have more concerns about coordination of care and have lower overall perceptions of quality.",

    "Only 12.9% of GPCA-positive patients are discovered to have PA by the WHO definition.",
    "There have been improvements in neonatal analgesia practices in Italy since national guidelines were published, but pain is still undertreated and underscored, especially during major invasive procedures. It is mandatory to address the gap between the recommendations in the guidelines and clinical practice must be addressed through with effective quality improvement initiatives.",
    "rhTGFβ1 effectively blocks rhBMP signaling in osteoblasts. As possible mechanism, we postulate an induction of SnoN that increases HDAC activity and thereby reduces the expression of factors required for efficient BMP signaling. Thus, inhibition of HDAC activity may support bone healing during rhBMP therapy in patients with elevated TGFβ serum levels.",
    "Providing basic information about effective methods might help to decrease ethnic disparities in use. Research should examine other variables that might account for these disparities, including health system characteristics and provider behavior.",
    "For conversations about sexual health, young urban parents prefer private forms of communication; thus, social networking sites may not aid STD interventions.",
    "Predictors for HCC recurrence can be identified before operation. These important parameters should be considered before and after contemplating curative resection for HCC patients and for risk stratification in future clinical trials for neoadjuvant or post-resection adjuvant therapy. The possible use of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment to improve survival should be addressed by further trials.",
    "In this pilot study, non-invasive assessment of the hemodynamic response to a volume load was not predictive of hypotension or vasopressor use during cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. Fluid responsiveness was related to hemodynamic responses at delivery.",
    "PCOS might be a predisposing condition for VTE, particularly among women aged 18-24 years. Oral contraceptive use might be protective.",
    "There is an increased risk of bleeding complications following TRUS-guided prostate biopsy with increased sampling numbers but these are minor. There is also an increased risk with low-dose aspirin use; however, there is no increased risk of bleeding complications with warfarin use. These results suggest that up to 10 cores during prostate biopsy remains acceptable safe practice and cessation of warfarin and low-dose aspirin is usually not necessary.",

    "VIP in synovial fluid and articular cartilage is negatively associated with progressive joint damage in OA and is a potential indictor of disease severity.",
    "Our results provide the evidence that oxLDL accelerates atherosclerotic plaque formation and may contribute to the development of microvascular complications in DM1.",
    "Our study has shown that a 10-core prostate biopsy protocol significantly improves cancer detection in patients with suspected early cancer. It should therefore be the optimum biopsy protocol for patients with gray-zone PSA value, with or without abnormal DRE.",
    "In spite of the strong association between multimorbidity and physical impairment, chronic morbidities explained only a small part of the age-related differences in physical performance.",
    "The clinical heterogeneity we have identified, which may well be explained by executive dysfunction, suggests further exploration of appropriate assessment and streams of care for those in the rehabilitation setting is warranted.",
    "Followup of femoral condyle osteochondral allografting demonstrated durable improvement in pain and function, with graft survivorship of 82% at 10 years.",
    "This study underlines that spontaneous reporting remained the most important source of drug withdrawals between 2005 and 2011. However, its relative importance decreased in comparison with that in 1997-2004. The importance of pharmacoepidemiological methods slightly increased but remained low. Finally, regulatory authorities seem to have more frequently based their safety decisions on multiple sources of evidence than before.",
    "Falls were responsible for most TBI, the home is the most common place of injury and non-operable TBI was common. These findings relate to all children. Significant gender differences exist from infancy. Boys sustained injuries associated with a greater energy transfer, were less likely to use protective devices and more likely to be injured deliberately. This results in a different pattern of injury, higher levels of associated injury and a higher mortality rate.",
    "Possible explanations for scope insensitivity are discussed; if cognitive limitations, emotional load and mental budgeting explain scope insensitivity there are grounds for rejecting valuations, whereas other factors such as the alternative theoretical framework of regret theory may render insensitivity to scope a result of rational thinking. It is concluded that future contingent valuation studies should focus more on extracting the underlying motives for the stated preferences in order to appropriately deal with responses that are seemingly irrational, and which may lead to imprecise welfare estimates.",
    "Neither the mean contact surface nor the number of contact surfaces of a day 3 embryo had an additional value in the prediction of live birth. The type of culture medium, however, had an impact on the contact surface of an embryo. Embryos cultured in a single medium had a significant larger contact surface compared to embryos cultured in the sequential medium.",
    "Ideal reconstruction of nonforeshortened 2D images from 3DFV does not lead to a relevant improvement in image geometry or the assessment of LV morphology and function. The automatic reconstruction algorithm deviates only slightly from manual results.",

    "Women were deemed to have sufficient relevant knowledge of the benefits and harms if they answered at least half of the items correctly.",
    "Those students that had considered leaving frequently described how a combination of diverse factors accumulated to lead to them contemplating leaving their programme. Strategies to reduce attrition in healthcare students need to consider the student lifecycle from recruitment to graduation, to set reasonable student expectations and ensure that a career within healthcare is both desired and valued.",
    "Sorafenib plus frequent low-dose IFN showed good efficacy and tolerability. Further investigations should be warranted to identify a possible positioning of this intriguing regimen (6% complete response rate) in the treatment scenario of mRCC.",
    "The involvement of surgical residents in mastectomy cases significantly increases operative times and cost. This difference is most apparent when junior-level residents are involved and disappears by the PGY4-PGY5. Increased operative costs and the lost opportunity costs for surgical attendings are significant issues associated with residency education. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education should consider such data when establishing appropriate reimbursements for graduate training programs.",
    "Transradial renal artery intervention is technically reliable with less invasion, rapid recovery, fewer complications and may become an alternative intervention approach for the treatment of renal artery stenosis.",
    "A significant difference was observed in gallbladder volumes in the group with biliary obstruction from choledocholithiasis compared with the group with biliary obstruction from other causes. Thus, objective measurement of gallbladder volume from modern cross-sectional imaging studies appears to validate Courvoisier's sign as a valuable clinical sign, which could be applied to modern imaging studies in distinguishing different causes of biliary obstruction in the jaundiced patient.",
    "The study supports a positive outcome after breast reduction surgery. Over 95% of the patients surveyed were satisfied and would do it again. It demonstrates the improvement of the patient's quality of life regardless of the amount of breast tissue removed. Furthermore, it suggests that the size and weight of the patient has no impact on this outcome. As we face new government and insurance restrictions for surgeries that have both cosmetic and reconstructive value, patient reported outcome studies may have an influence on future third-party payer.",
    "The FWS and SGA represent the current standard of cosmetic outcomes measures; however, when subjected to scrutiny they display relatively unpredictable agreement even among plastic surgeons. Compared to the FWS, the SGA has a more acceptable user concordance, especially among plastic surgeons accustomed to using such scales. The interobserver variability of FWS and SGA scoring underlines the need to explore objective, quantitative cosmetic outcomes measures.",
    "The finding that medical claims provided by a medieval author are significantly related to modern herbal use supports the importance of traditional medicinal systems as an empirical source. However, since many traditional claims are not in accordance with modern applications, they should be used carefully and analyzed in a systematic, statistics-based manner. Our statistical approach can be used for further systematic comparison of herbal claims of traditional sources as well as in the fields of ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology.",

    "Although not predictive for tumor behavior, some correlations existed between dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and 18F-FDG-PET parameters. Vascular metabolic ratio may provide further information on tumor behavior; however, this needs to be evaluated with further larger studies.",
    "The MSCs population was significantly higher in infants born at lesser gestation than those born at term gestation.",
    "We recommend that patients with a diagnosis of labral tear, FAI or a chondral lesion should undergo hip arthroscopic surgery within six months of symptom onset. Patients with persistent symptoms for over three years should be made aware of the poorer outcome after hip arthroscopy.",

    "In a large cohort of patients newly treated by basal insulin, no increased risk of any cancer was observed in insulin glargine users compared with other basal insulin users. Because follow-up did not exceed 4 years, longer-term studies are needed.",
    "In euthyroid individuals without a history of thyroid disease, there is a modest relationship between thyroid function and fatigue with subjects having an apparently higher production of T(4) experiencing more fatigue. Subjects with a history of thyroid disease, but with normal TSH and FT(4) concentrations, experience more fatigue than the general population. The reasons for this are unclear, but subtle abnormalities in the dynamics of thyroid hormone secretion should be considered.",
    "A single 24-hour urine collection may have changed clinical decision making in up to 45% of patients. Therefore, we recommend two collections to optimize the diagnostic yield and appropriately target stone prevention strategies.",
    "This study suggests that pregnancy is associated with a premature deterioration in RV function in women with a systemic RV. These women are also more symptomatic, with a greater reduction in functional class compared with patients with a systemic RV who do not undergo pregnancy. This study will allow this cohort of women to be more accurately counseled as to the potential long-term risks of pregnancy.",
    "CT-scan-based measurements differed from the intraoperative measurements, however preoperative CT-scan evaluation may be a useful tool to identify patients with short distance of coronaries.",
    "The differences in endoparasites between P. toxostoma and C. nasus in allopatry are probably linked to different feeding or habitat conditions, but host-parasite evolutionary associations also play an important role in determining the presence of Chondrostoma-specific monogeneans. Our findings suggest that Dactylogyrus expanded with the source host C. nasus into introduced areas and that P. toxostoma became infected after contact with C. nasus. Although the genotype of P. toxostoma and recombinant genotypes of hybrids are susceptible to Dactylogyrus transmitted from C. nasus, the intensity of infection is low in these genotypes.",

    "The use of the indicator variable instead the FFQ appears as a good alternative to estimate usual intake of episodically consumed foods.",
    "Most women with POI are deficient in vit D. Zinc, copper, and vit D seem to correlate with hormonal status in the participants. The present study may generate hypotheses for future studies that will investigate the possible mechanisms behind alterations in trace elements and vit D deficiency in women with POI and whether these changes could be used to screen for the risk of developing POI.",
    "Low 25-OHD was not a significant factor for hypocalcemia and did not lower the accuracy of quick PTH in predicting postthyroidectomy hypocalcemia.",
    "Graft quality in ReLT has worsened with time mainly because of older donors but nowadays the use of high-risk grafts in non-urgent ReLT is not associated with worse graft survival because of better perioperative management. Moreover of being selective on recipient conditions, care should be taken when using grafts from donors over 60-years-old for non-urgent ReLT.",
    "It was shown that one session of acupuncture treatment results in acute improvements in pressure pain sensitivity in the neck and calf of patients with chronic WAD. Acupuncture had no effect on conditioned pain modulation or temporal summation of pressure pain. Both acupuncture and relaxation appear to be well-tolerated treatments for people with chronic WAD. These findings suggest that acupuncture treatment activates endogenous analgesia in patients with chronic WAD.",
    "The association between QTcD and MMSE requires cautious interpretation and further extensive investigation. However, if confirmed by longitudinal studies, the finding could play a role in the management of the subjects with MCI.",
    "EGCs of the absolute group are immunohistochemically stable. The presence of LVI may be carefully examined by IHCS in an ESD expanded indication group with an invasion depth of M3 or greater.",
    "Actigraphy did not correlate well with disease severity or quality of life when used as an objective outcome measure in a multicentre clinical trial, and was not responsive to change over time. Further work is needed to establish why this might be, and to establish improved methods of distinguishing between eczema-related and eczema-nonrelated movements.",
    "Oral health counseling increased plaque removal efficacy and control of gingival inflammation. The efficiency of counseling and traditional education was similar. Counseling is a promising approach that warrants further attention in a variety of dental contexts.",

    "Warfarin therapy administered concomitantly with an antiplatelet agent dramatically reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke associated with postoperative PAF.",
    "We evidenced a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and COPD among HIV-infected patients. HIV infection, current cigarette smoking and previous bacterial pneumonia seem to play a significant role in the development of respiratory symptoms and COPD. Thus, our results suggest that the most at-risk HIV-infected patients should be screened for COPD to early identify those who may need specific treatment.",
    "The RWI may offer several advantages over a cochleostomy, and it seems to be a reliable, safe, and effective technique for cochlear implantation with today's cochlear implant electrodes. Further studies would be necessary to verify these findings for broad application to the cochlear implant patient population.",
    "Our data do not support the hypothesis that polymorphisms in the B3AR gene are associated with alterations of bladder function.",

    "In patients with prostate cancer who have previously undergone TURP, we observed that HDR brachytherapy was able to control prostate cancer with fewer GU morbidities and oncological outcomes that were similar to those associated with traditional EBRT alone. Moreover, HDR brachytherapy led to a decrease in major GU toxicity and also preserved the sphincter function more than that in TURP patients who underwent EBRT alone.",
    "Our observations suggested fresh osteochondral allografts restored short-term function in patients with juvenile OCD who failed standard treatments.",
    "Controlling fast-multiplying P. falciparum blood stages requires a strong inflammatory response to prevent fulminant infections, while reducing inflammation-related tissue damage with early regulatory cytokine responses may be a more cost-effective strategy in infections with the less virulent P. vivax parasite. The early induction of regulatory cytokines may be a critical mechanism protecting vivax malaria patients from severe clinical complications.",

    "Based on the women's and partners' experiences an organizational model of the combined MHC&CHC where the same nurse will take care of family during pregnancy and after birth of the child was preferred. This model also provides greater amount of home visits and peer support than the separate MHC.",

    "We believe that these findings will inform others undertaking integrated knowledge translation activities and will encourage others to become more engaged in feedback processes.",
    "Despite a poor health referral system in our country, our results are no different from those reported from the developed world. Surgical margins and tumor grade prognostically influenced LRFS, MFS and OS.",
    "These data suggest the possibility that topical DHEA could be used as an efficient and physiological antiageing skin agent.",
    "This study indicates that lower COC is associated with increased hospital admissions and ED visits, even in a health care system that lacks a referral arrangement framework. This suggests that improving the COC is beneficial both for patients and for the health care system.",
    "Our analyses suggest that despite its advantages of being non-invasive, the diagnostic effect of TRUS is limited by both accuracy and reliability. In contrast, although an invasive radiographic imaging method, FNV has been proven as being informative when providing preoperative details about obstruction and other symptoms. After 3 years of research we came to the conclusion that opening fine-needle punctuation and vasography have not become outdated, at least recently, and will remain a necessary and effective method to identify diseases and to provide a strictly defined morphology of the seminal vesicle and ductal system for more comprehensive diagnosis of obstructive azoospermia of EDO.",
    "In our experience, the prior practice of delayed cranioplasty (3-6 months postdecompressive craniectomy), requiring repeat hospital admission, does not seem to lower postcranioplasty infection rates nor the need for cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures. Our current practice emphasizes cranioplasty during the initial hospital admission, as soon as there is resolution on computed tomography scan of brain swelling outside of the cranial vault with concurrent clinical examination. This occurs as early as 2 weeks postcraniectomy and should lower the overall cost of care by eliminating the need for additional hospital admissions.",
    "Sixteen-channel multidetector row CT images reconstructed using a soft algorithm and a wide display FOV that cover the entire abdomen using a visceral organ-targeted protocol with 1.5-mm collimation are sufficient for the evaluation of spine fractures in trauma patients, given that multiplanar-reformatted images are provided.",

    "We observed no fractures of the ceramic heads implanted on a previous titanium trunion. This approach is possible if inspection shows no major imperfection of the Morse taper.",
    "Substantial gender functional differences exist before treatment. However, women reported greater improvement as a result of the intervention when compared with men.",
    "Patients with a local recurrence of a soft tissue sarcoma have a poor prognosis. Limb salvage and additional radiotherapy remain possible but with substantial complications. Amputation did not prevent additional local recurrence or death.",
    "The early- and late-onset preeclampsia placentas showed clear histopathological differences, whereas late-onset preeclampsia and normal term placentas differed less. These findings support the contention that early- and late-onset preeclampsia are different subclasses of disease.",
    "In this group of women with previous preeclampsia, neither baseline C-reactive protein concentration nor change in concentration over gestation was associated with recurrent preeclampsia.",
    "There were no differences in the insulin resitance indexes between the group with SPE and normal controls.",
    "In this, the largest series of duodenal atresia patients compiled to date, the rate of a concomitant jejunoileal atresia is less than 1%. This low incidence is not high enough to mandate extensive inspection of the entire bowel in these patients, and a second atresia should not be a concern during laparoscopic repair of duodenal atresia.",
    "Participation in SNAP or SSI was associated with obesity independent of food insecurity or socio-economic status. The suggestion that these associations may be mediated by dietary quality warrants further investigation among low-income populations.",
    "Our finding suggests that there is no association between ACI and positive CP-IgG in Iranian patients.",
    "We provide better and more robust evidence that routine modification of limb electrode placement produces only minor changes to the ECG waveform in healthy subjects. These are not clinically significant according to the 2009 guidelines and thus have no effect on the clinical specificity of the 12 lead ECG.",
    "The rational use of ANCA testing to aid in the diagnosis of vasculitis should include a clinical gating policy to improve diagnostic performance. Adherence to a gating policy for ANCA testing coupled with close liaison between clinician and laboratory does not result in either a missed or delayed diagnosis of small-vessel vasculitis belonging to the WG-MPA spectrum.",
    "Presently there is not enough evidence to indict a large (>6 cm) PCC as malignant. Furthermore, PASS cannot be reliably applied to PCC for predicting malignancy.",
    "Clearly perceived rules about smoking encourage students not to smoke on school grounds; however, perceptions of rules, along with strong enforcement, may displace behavior off of school grounds. Non-smoking policies should be part of a comprehensive approach, that supports cessation.",
    "Almost half of Swiss resident youths are involved in gambling. Both occasional and frequent gambling are associated with further health compromising behaviour. Practitioners dealing with young people should be aware that gambling is a behaviour that might be part of a more global risky behaviour framework.",
    "The incidence of retinopathy among patients using antimalarial medications as observed in this study was relatively high. Based on these results, it is essential to emphasize the importance of close monitoring in patients receiving antimalarial medications and evaluation of visual findings before treatment initiation.",
    "Internet surveys can be a useful tool for screening the general population for common allergic disorders, such as urticaria.",
    "HoNOS has satisfactory sensitivity and predictive validity for routine use. We could introduce the adult version and HoNOSCA simultaneously and collect data using routine databases. Given the widespread routine use of HoNOS internationally, using the same outcome measure in Canada would enable comparisons of illness severity and outcomes between jurisdictions.",
    "Completion of an accelerated skills course results in comparable levels of student performance postcourse across a variety of preclinical backgrounds and clerkship experiences.",
    "Increasing risk of LN involvement in the elderly can be explained by delayed diagnosis in this age group. Lack of systematic screening programs for this subpopulation and tendency of the elderly to wait longer before consulting a physician might be blamed. Aging per se does not increase the risk of LN involvement.",
    "Participation in a procedural skills workshop during family practice residency did not produce a significant increase in the performance of these skills on the part of participants once they were in clinical practice. The benefit of a skills workshop might be lost when there is no opportunity to practise and perfect these skills. Sex bias in the case of some procedures might represent a needs-based acquisition of skills on the part of practising physicians. Short procedural skills workshops might be better suited to graduated physicians with more clinical experience.",
    "The SURE screening test shows promise for screening for decisional conflict in both French- and English-speaking patients; however, future studies should assess its performance in a broader group of patients.",
    "Despite a relatively low initial success rate (60%), most rectovaginal fistulas can be successfully repaired with subsequent operations. Crohn's disease and smoking are associated with adverse outcomes.",
    "In children with PP-FGIDs, investigations are common, costs are substantial, and yield is minimal.",
    "Since the introduction of minimally invasive surgery at our tertiary referral center in 1997, the number of patients referred for an antireflux operation has increased. This cannot be explained by an increase of referrals from outside the region or a change in the indication for surgery. We conclude that laparoscopy lowers the threshold for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children.",
    "Oral NaB given during the preweaning period did not significantly decrease the subsequent development of death from diabetes in biobreeding diabetes-prone rats.",
    "It is difficult to prove whether the chorioretinal atrophy was caused by the subretinal TB or by the accidental forceful dye injection, but subretinal TB and contact of TB with the retinal pigment epithelium should be avoided, and precautions should be taken during intravitreal injection. We suggest a more controlled method of dye injection in such cases using the flute needle rather than the syringe technique that is conventionally used.",
    "For both patients, several unrecognized confounding factors for NDD were present. These cases illustrate the difficulties encountered by experienced clinicians in determining brain death using clinical criteria alone, and they suggest that more routine use of ancillary brain blood flow analyses should be recommended.",
    "There was no difference in the incidence of varicella complication in children and adults, but the type of complication differed. In children the most common complications were skin and neurological infections, while in adults it was varicella pneumonia. These data provide a baseline for estimating the burden of varicella in Belgrade and support the inclusion of varicella vaccine in childhood immunisation program in Serbia.",
    "the higher rate of pregnancy complications for women ≥ 40 years is not further increased after 45 years of age.",
    "There is no rationale to criticize the low specificity of breast MRI when used as an adjunct to mammography. The independency of the diagnostic accuracy of breast MRI from breast density makes it a worthwhile choice in mammographic BI-RADS 0 cases.",
    "In addition to white light cystoscopy, CLE is a promising novel tool for the in vivo microscopic visualization of bladder cancer; first results of the present study show its potential to define microscopic characteristics of bladder cancer tissue. Further in vivo studies are necessary to determine sensitivity and specificity of the technique.",
    "The evidence demonstrates that mandibular bone height has no effect on patients' satisfaction with the function, chewing ability and comfort of their prostheses. Furthermore, no matter how much mandibular bone, these results suggest that edentulous elders will benefit more from mandibular IODs than from CDs.",
    "Loss of plakoglobin immunoreactivity from the intercalated disks appears to be the endpoint of complex pathologic changes, and our functional data suggest that yet unknown posttranslational modifications of desmoglein-2 might be involved.",

    "The continuum of CLs ≥25 mm measured between 16(0/7)-22(6/7) weeks does not predict gestational length in women with prior spontaneous preterm birth.",
    "Clinicians have considerable difficulty accurately identifying distress and mild depression in primary care with only one in three people correctly diagnosed. Clinicians are better able to identify distress than mild depression but success remains limited. However not all such individuals want professional help, and some people who are overlooked get help elsewhere, or improve spontaneously, therefore the implications of these detection problems are not yet clear.",
    "Successful NOM, especially for blunt mechanisms, diminishes traditional opportunities for residents to garner adequate operative experience with SAOI. Fewer operative occasions may necessitate an increased role for standardized, curriculum-based simulation training.",
    "Our findings indicate that pulsed ultrasound accelerates the consolidation of rib fractures. This study is the first to show that pulsed ultrasound promotes the healing of rib fractures. From a translational point of view, this easy, cheap technique could serve as an effective new therapeutic modality in patients with rib fractures.",
    "Prior abdominal surgery was not associated with a statistically significant increase in overall operating time, robotic assist time, margin positivity, or incidence of complications in patients undergoing RALP. Robotic prostatectomy can be safely and satisfactorily performed in patients who have had a wide variety of prior abdominal surgery types.",
    "Long-term risk of TVR was slightly lower with SES, compared with PES, despite no significant difference in major adverse cardiac events. However, the SES group had more frequent target lesion reintervention 2 to 5 years after stent implantation, whereas reintervention in the PES group occurred mainly within the first 2 years. This may reflect the temporal difference in neointimal growth of the two stent types.",
    "During cardiac arrests in children ≥ 8 yrs, TTI decreased after biphasic shocks, but the limited magnitude and duration of TTI changes suggest that stacked-shocks would not improve defibrillation success.",

    "In patients with a previously failed endocardial VT ablation, epicardial mapping reveals a VT substrate in nearly three fourths of all patients, and epicardial ablation is required for successful VT abolition in more than half of patients. However, life-threatening complications may occur. Repeat epicardial access was not possible in 25% due to local pericardial adhesions.",
    "Previous RARP case volume might affect the operative time, blood loss, and lymph node yield at robot-assisted radical cystectomy. In addition, surgeons with increased RARP experience operated on patients with more advanced tumors. Previous RARP experience, however, did not appear to affect the surgical margin status.",
    "LXRA together with ABCA1 are specifically expressed in the human placenta and can be regulated by hypoxia. Deregulation of this system in early preeclampsia might be the result of placental hypoxia and hence might have consequences for maternal-fetal cholesterol transport.",
    "Few pregnant adolescents made informed decisions about maternal serum screening. Clinicians face a challenge to improve adolescents' knowledge about maternal serum screening.",

    "It is concluded that other ancillary tests like sputum examination and/or, where available, Interferon and ESAT tests should be carried out before chest radiograph is requested in subjects with positive Mantoux reaction.",
    "Direct fluorescence antibody assay testing is a suboptimal method for the detection of respiratory viruses in critically ill children with lower respiratory tract infection. Given the importance of a prompt and accurate viral diagnosis for this group of patients, we suggest that real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction becomes part of the routine diagnostic algorithm in critically ill children when a viral etiology is suspected, even if conventional tests yield a negative result.",
    "With a vast majority of private practitioners unable to provide a correct prescription for treating TB and not approached by the national TB programme, little seems to have changed over the years. Strategies to control TB through public sector health services will have little impact if inappropriate management of TB patients in private clinics continues unabated. Large scale implementation of public-private mix approaches should be a top priority for the programme. Ignoring the private sector could worsen the epidemic of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant forms of TB.",
    "PWA participated in fewer activities and reported worse quality of life after stroke than people without aphasia, even when their physical abilities, well-being and social support were comparable. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.",
    "These Australian population-based data confirm an improvement in survival from haematological malignancies across all three age groups, but an age-related survival gap remains for adolescents and young adults compared with children, especially for young adults with ALL. Greater participation of adolescents and young adults in clinical trials and more detailed data collection are needed to provide evidence about optimal treatment regimens in these age groups.",
    "We report a high prevalence of positive testing for bipolar disorder in this fibromyalgia cohort. Clinical data and questionnaire instruments other than nonspecific high depression severity failed to identify these patients. Since the norepinephrine serotonin reuptake inhibitors duloxetine and milnacipran have been recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of fibromyalgia, and because patients with bipolar disorder may experience destabilization of mood when treated with such agents, patients with fibromyalgia should be systematically screened for bipolar disorder prior to treatment.",
    "Teachers' sub-fertility appears as an 'occupational disease'. Τhe possibility that results from their exposure to childhood viral infections has to be further explored.",
    "Documentation of vital parameters is carried out incompletely, and documentation of respiratory rate is particularly poor, making calculation of accepted emergency scores infeasible for a significant fraction of a given test population. The suitability of paper-based documentation is therefore limited. Electronic documentation that includes real-time plausibility checks might improve data quality. Further research is warranted.",

    "These data suggest that serotonin produced by pancreatic endocrine neoplasms may be associated with local fibrosis and stenosis of the pancreatic duct. Clinicians should be aware that small pancreatic endocrine neoplasms can produce pancreatic duct stenosis resulting in ductal dilatation and/or upstream pancreatic atrophy out of proportion to the size of the tumor.",
    "Patients making decisions about treatments for which no evidence supports benefit and decisions about noncurative treatments reported more physician control, which suggests that patients may not want the responsibility of deciding on treatments that will not cure them. Better strategies for shared decision making may be needed when there is no evidence to support benefit of a treatment or when patients have terminal illnesses that cannot be cured.",

    "The present study supports the theory that for ARM patients the prognosis in terms of continence depends mainly on the type of malformation and is not complicated by the association with ND. In our series neurosurgical treatments did not have any effect in improving the continence of ARM patients and a conservative management of ND did not expose the patients to the sequelae of progressive deterioration, reported elsewhere, requiring rescue neurosurgery. We believe that the correct practice of pediatric surgeons following-up ARM patients is a protocol which includes appropriate investigations to detect the presence of a SD or ND and, once these entities are detected, it is mandatory to manage the patient with a multidisciplinary team, where a conservative non-operative management is initially justified and advocated in the absence of neurosensorymotor symptoms.",
    "The desired proximal load transfer of a short-stemmed implant in the metaphyseal region of the proximal femur could not be reached with this device. On the basis of the excellent clinical results of the patients operated with the Nanos short-stem prosthesis we conclude that the component induces bone ingrowth in the lateral/distal region of the proximal femur.",

However, the sensitivity for EP was too low for the model to be used in clinical practice in its present form. Our data illustrate the difficulties of applying algorithms from one center to another, where the definitions of pathology may differ.",

    "When groups were not matched for baseline severity, the use of the FAB defined a group of AD subjects with greater executive dysfunction that were distinguished from both the remainder of the AD and FTLD subjects in almost all domains except behavioral disturbance and probably were just more severely affected AD subjects. The FAB is thus more useful as a marker of dementia severity than as a scale to detect a frontal variant of AD or to distinguish AD from FTLD. Controlling for severity, however, did allow the definition of a subgroup of AD subjects that more closely resembled FTLD subjects than the remainder of the AD subjects. It is proposed that subjects with dementia presenting with greater executive impairment but without prominent behavioral symptoms are likely to have AD rather than FTLD, especially if they are quite functionally impaired. With time FTLD subjects develop increasing executive dysfunction and increasingly resemble the more severely affected AD subjects.",

    "Studies of these plants indicate that they may be useful as a possible alternative and/or complementary approach for studies aimed at the treatment of FSD. At this time, however, this review cannot recommend a plant that has a strong enough level of evidence for treatment of FSD. Thus, there is a need for clinical (double-blinded and randomized) studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of several plants that can exert a positive effect on the management of FSD.",
    "The majority of the actions recommended by pharmacists during the medication review process were consistent with the literature embedded in key Australian information sources. Medication management in older people is complex and challenging, as highlighted by the DRPs identified in 98% of our patients. A suitably trained pharmacist, with full access to the patient, medical record and supporting resources, can help to improve the quality use of medicines in this at-risk population.",

    "A spatial model was drawn to explain the role of the subcellular sequestration of STR and SGD to control the MIA metabolic flux under normal physiological conditions. The model also illustrates the possible mechanism of massive activation of the strictosidine vacuolar pool upon enzyme-substrate reunion occurring during potential herbivore feeding constituting a so-called \"nuclear time bomb\" in reference to the \"mustard oil bomb\" commonly used to describe the myrosinase-glucosinolate defence system in Brassicaceae.",
    "Children with higher levels of emotional distress at kindergarten were more inclined toward child gambling behaviour in Grade 6. The influence of early emotional distress completely vanished when behaviours reflecting impulsivity were considered when predicting later child gambling behaviour. The relation between emotional distress and child gambling involvement in children was thus explained by its comorbidity with early impulsivity. This study does not rule out the possibility that emotional distress could become a correlate or consequence of excessive involvement in gambling activities at a later developmental period.",

    "Increased lactate and LPI were frequent findings after acute TBI and in most cases they were not related to episodes of brain tissue hypoxia. Furthermore, the concordance between both biomarkers to classify metabolic dysfunction was weak. LPI and lactate should not be used indistinctly in everyday clinical practice because of the weak correlation between these two markers, the difficulty in their interpretation and the heterogeneous and complex nature of the pathophysiology. Other differential diagnoses apart from tissue hypoxia should always be considered when high lactate and/or LPI are detected in the acute injured brain.",

    "There was a large variation in number of colonies cultured. Handwashing resulted in a statistically significant reduction in colony count on fingers, palms and dominant wrist regardless of clothing. We conclude that handwashing produces a significant reduction in number of bacterial colonies on staff hands, and that clothing that is not BBE does not impede this reduction.",
    "Removal of hardware alone is a reasonable option to offer as a relatively minor procedure following a failed arthrodesis of the first MTPJ. This must be accepted on the proviso that in this study four out of 11 (36%) patients proceeded to a revision first MTPJ fusion or first MTPJ replacement. We also found that the rate of non-union in primary first MTPJ fusion was significantly higher in males and those patients who had undergone previous surgery.",
    "These preliminary findings suggest earlier maturation in men is associated with better cognitive function in later adulthood. Whether pubertal timing is a marker of earlier life exposures or reflects a biological relation between somatrophic and/or gonadotrophic hormones and cognitive development is unclear.",

    "Retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy for end stage renal disease is a safe, effective technique that preserves peritoneal integrity in children who require immediate postoperative peritoneal dialysis. Avoiding post-nephrectomy hemodialysis decreases patient morbidity, preserving vessels for future vascular access. Compared to the literature on laparoscopy in this setting, retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy can be considered the ideal approach for minimally invasive nephrectomy in patients on peritoneal dialysis.",
    "Outcome data on severely masculinized 46,XX patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia who were assigned male gender at birth indicate male gender identity in adulthood with satisfactory male sexual function in those retaining male genitalia. In men who completed questionnaires results were poorer in those lacking familial/social support. Male gender of rearing may be a viable option for parents whose children are born with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a 46,XX karyotype and male genitalia, although positive parental and other support, and counseling are needed for adjustment.",

    "The results suggest that a subtly disturbed intracortical excitability characterizes patients with chronic insomnia: a relatively reduced intracortical facilitation in the context of a globally increased absolute excitability. The findings do not resemble TMS findings after sleep deprivation or in sleep apnea and thus seem specific to insomnia.

    "1. Extraction of ICD and PM leads is associated with a similar risk for developing major complications, however minor complications are more often during extraction of ICD leads. 2. A larger number of double coil leads may be the cause of complications despite a shorter time period elapsing from ICD implantation. 3. A probable cause of complications during ICD lead extraction is the pronounced growth of the connective tissue around the coils. However, further studies are required to clarify this phenomenon. 4. The success rate of ICD leads extraction using our own surgical technique is similar to that reported by other investigators using laser systems.",
    "A high prevalence of DS, especially among women, has been observed in the Polish population. The DS were found in every fourth man and every third woman. In both groups, subjects with DS were characterised by more anti-health lifestyle compared to healthy individuals. Of all the analysed factors of anti-health lifestyle the following were significantly and independently associated with DS - lack of physical activity and smoking in both sexes and, additionally, regular alcohol consumption in women.",

    "A 35% false-positive rate was found for the diagnosis of compartment syndrome in patients with tibial shaft fractures who were not thought to have compartment syndrome by using currently accepted criteria for diagnosis based solely on one-time compartment pressure measurements. Our data suggest that reliance on one-time intracompartmental pressure measurements can overestimate the rate of compartment syndrome and raise concern regarding unnecessary fasciotomies.",
    "Overall, surgical interventions are significantly lower among the SVI cohort than the G4 CSL cohort. Further analysis using a larger cohort of patients is recommended before revising the current renal grading system. Adding SVI as a G4 injury could potentially increase the heterogeneity of G4 injuries and decrease the ability of the AAST renal injury grading system to predict outcomes, such as nephrectomy rate.",

    "These findings confirm the high rate of symptom co-morbidities among cancer patients and highlight strong associations between sleep and fatigue. CBT-I appears to offer generalised benefit to the symptom cluster as a whole and, specifically, is effective in reducing fatigue, which exceeded clinical cut-offs prior to implementation of the intervention. This has implications for the diagnosis/management of common symptoms in cancer patients.",

    "Most Western Australian health professionals working with breast cancer patients are willing to accept an increase in risk of local recurrence in order to replace EBRT with IORT in a hypothetical setting. This finding was consistent over two time points spanning 7 years despite the duration of clinical experience with IORT and the publication of the early clinical results of IORT in 2010. These results need to be compared with preferences elicited from patient groups, and further investigation into the impact of personal preferences on health professionals' advice to patients is warranted.",
    "While a pilot study, our qualitative reports indicate that CBT may provide a useful role in managing melancholia as an adjunct to antidepressant medication. Future studies examining such a combination treatment model should seek to determine if indicative data provided here argue for a sequencing model of CBT being introduced after medication has addressed core biological underpinnings.",

    "In this initial study, using local health care providers to collect data did not bias data collection. The bias observed in the knowledge indicators is most likely due to the 'practice effect', whereby respondents increased their knowledge as a result of completing the first survey, as no corresponding effect was seen in the practices indicators.",
    "Despite obvious disparities between the hospitals, the medical assistance scenario was not an independent predictor of survival.

Because of the small effect sizes, the measurement differences between the online assessed CAPE and its paper and pencil original can be neglected without major consequences for research purposes. However, a person with a high vulnerability for psychotic symptoms would score 4.80 points lower on the total scale if the CAPE is assessed online compared to paper and pencil assessment. Therefore, for clinical purposes, one should be cautious with online assessment of the CAPE.",

    "Nicorandil was deemed to be the most likely cause for the patient's ulcer. Nicorandil is an anti-anginal medication known to cause oral ulceration and skin lesions in the perianal and peristomal regions and around surgical wounds. However, there are no previously reported cases of facial ulcers. The ulcer required surgical debridement and healed completely within six months, following discontinuation of nicorandil. This case highlights the importance of having a high index of clinical suspicion regarding non-healing ulcers, and of considering drugs as an aetiological factor, especially in patients with a complex medical background who are taking numerous medications.",

    "Despite recent reforms, the Australian Government continues to pay higher prices than its English counterpart for many generic medications. The results suggest that particular policy areas may benefit from review in Australia, including the length of the price-setting process, the frequency of subsequent price adjustments, the extent of price competition between originators and generics, medical professionals' knowledge about generic medicines and incentives for generic prescribing. WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE TOPIC? Prices of generic drugs have been the subject of much scrutiny over recent years. From 2005 to 2010 the Australian Government responded to observations that Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prices for many generics were higher than in numerous comparable countries by instituting several reforms aimed at reducing the prices of generics. Despite this, several studies have demonstrated that prices for generic statins (one class of cholesterol-lowering drug) are higher in Australia compared with England and many other developed countries, and prices of numerous other generics remain higher than in the USA and New Zealand. Recently there has been increasing interest in why these differences exist. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD? By including a much larger range of commonly used and costly generic drugs, this paper builds significantly on the limited previous investigations of generic drug prices in Australia and England. Additionally, this is the first comprehensive investigation of multiple supply- and, in particular, demand-side factors that may explain any price differences between these countries. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS? Practitioners may contribute to the higher prices of generic medications in Australia compared with England through relatively low rates of generic prescribing. There are also significant implications for health policy makers, as this paper demonstrates that if Australia achieved the same prices as England for many generic drugs there could be substantial savings for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.",

Accordingly, with the present state of knowledge concerning the risk of melanoma, both the number and density of naevi should be considered as equally valid in future studies as markers of the risk of melanoma, and in studies on the natural history of naevi. If the disease mechanism is systemic, and not related to particular naevi, naevus density might form the better marker of risk. However, if the disease mechanism is related to effects on particular naevi, then the risk would vary in proportion to the number of naevi.",

    "Careful analysis of the timing and presentation of perioperative neurologic events after CEA can predict which cases are likely to improve with reoperation. Neurologic deficits that present during the first 24 hours after CEA are likely to be related to intraluminal thrombus formation and embolization. Unless another etiology for stroke has clearly been established, we think immediate reexploration of the artery without other confirmatory tests is mandatory to remove the embolic source and correct any technical problems. This will likely improve the neurologic outcome in these patients, because an uncorrected situation would lead to continued embolization and compromise.",
    "On a national level, over the past 19 years, our ability to identify and to treat patients with AAA has not improved. Advances in technology and critical care have not affected outcome.

Most show a slowly progressing puberty. However, careful follow-up of these patients is necessary up to at least 9 years of age, because until then height prediction may deteriorate, necessitating gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment in one third of the cases.",
    "FNMTC is more aggressive than sporadic non-medullary thyroid cancer. The best predictors of a poor outcome in patients with FNMTC are the number of family members affected by thyroid cancer and evidence of distant metastasis.",
    "Penetrance of the c804 mutation is highly variable. Medullary thyroid carcinoma associated with this genotype has aggressive potential. Prophylactic thyroidectomy in childhood is a viable approach.",
    "Breast cancer patients' need of control over their own life prompts an interest in alternative dietary habits after diagnosis, the focus being on a healthier diet. Expert dietary information is considered important. Many patients mentioned a lack of precise dietary recommendations for their individual disease situation and depended on information from outside their treatment centre.",
    "While bed sharing showed an increased risk of dying accidentally, when compared with infants sleeping in designated infant containers, the risk of accidental death in this study was even greater for infants left alone on adult beds or couches.",
    "Acid base determination is a useful screening tool when considering pyloric stenosis. This model now needs to be validated on a prospective series of patients with vomiting.",
    "Initial prescribing of an antibiotic reduces early follow-up for acute bronchitis in younger patients but seems to have no effect in adults. However, reductions in future follow-up visits might be outweighed by increases in antibiotic consumption because patients who return for a follow-up visit seem to receive additional antibiotic prescriptions.

    "These findings suggest that sensory processing dysfunction in schizophrenia is particularly severe in a subgroup of patients who can be considered poor-outcome based on their need for long-term residential treatment. Furthermore, the absence of increased auditory distractibility argues against prefrontal dysfunction as an origin for auditory sensory imprecision in schizophrenia. Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2000;57:1149-1155.",

    "Disposable trocars are difficult to resterilize and may harbor infectious viruses after their initial use. Therefore, the reuse of disposable trocars in laparoscopic surgery cannot be recommended.",
    "Suffering from an urinary tract infection has a detrimental influence on patient quality of life. The effect of urinary tract infections on women and their perception of quality of life have not been hitherto reported in the medical literature. The significant findings in this study call into question whether acute, non-life-threatening illness should be regarded as benign.",
    "Haematological features are subtle and can be easily overlooked, and individual patients may not display all the abnormal features. X-linked ataxias are rare and incorrect genetic advice may be given if the diagnostic haematological features of X-linked sideroblastic anaemia are overlooked. Males with early onset ataxia should have a haematological evaluation including a blood film, with a bone marrow examination if abnormal blood count indices and measurement of FEP concentrations raise suspicion. The condition has parallels with Pearson's syndrome and Friedreich's ataxia. All three conditions are associated with mitochondrial iron handling defects and ataxia. The human ATP binding cassette gene (hABC7) is a candidate gene and requires further investigation.",
    "Increased serum inhibin A may indicate that a proportion of mild nonproteinuric hypertension cases are associated with placental involvement.",
    "Mammogram is of limited value in management of Paget's disease of the breast for women without breast palpable mass; it can not predict the site of malignancy, nor the invasive component.",
    "This survey showed that no healthcare professional seems to have a clearly defined role in informing potential patients about screening. The general public, who seem to perceive from the media that early detection is beneficial, are confused by the lack of clarity about policies for urological cancers.",
    "Our results indicate that deposition of elastic system fibres is present in the fibroproliferative phase of ARDS and in usual interstitial pneumonia and suggest that this event may contribute to the alveolar mechanical dysfunction and remodelling that occur in acute and chronic interstitial lung disease.",
    "The infiltration of T cells into oral mucosa was increased in treated coeliac disease patients in spite of adherence to a gluten-free diet. Because the CD3(+) T cell count was higher than those of the TCR alpha beta+ and TCR gamma delta+ T cells, there must be other cells involved, probably natural killer (NK) cells. The increase in T-cell subsets in the treated coeliac disease patients seems not to result from poor dietary compliance, but might occur as a late immune response in coeliac disease and reflect chronic immunologic stimulation followed by regeneration of memory T cells.",
    "On the basis of our data, human myometrial sampling at cesarean delivery does not increase overall maternal morbidity, irrespective of gestational age and the presence or absence of labor.",
    "Although both GPD and PBD are useful and complementary, PBD alone identified the SN in 100% of the inguinal lymphatic basins.",
    "High levels of parental smoking in the home are associated with a reduction in health care contacts for asthma. This could be due to a lack of awareness of asthma symptoms among heavy smokers or a reluctance to visit the GP. Children with asthma who have parents who smoke heavily may not be receiving adequate management.",
    "This survey shows that many hospitals are inadequately prepared to manage latex-allergic patients, because they lack anaesthetic and urological latex-free equipment.",

    "GPs commonly have problems in drug dosing for certain groups of patients. The development and use of computerized decision support might help GPs in these situations.",
    "Tumour plaques were the commonest pattern of recurrent axillary disease. Forty-eight percent of the patients had metastatic deposits identified by MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging had excellent specificity (100%) and good sensitivity (89%) for recurrent axillary tumour compared with outcome at 1 year, which was improved by non-dynamic administration of Gd-DTPA in 32% of the subset who received it.",

    "Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms involving the ureters and compressing the urinary structures respond well to aneurysmal resection only without a urological procedure.",
    "Analysis of our data supports the findings of the earlier series that the majority of patients present with muscle invasive bladder cancer. However, there is a significant decrease in the percentage of tumors invading the muscularis propria at presentation. Although this observation is encouraging, we emphasize that it is not as dramatic as the stage migration associated with prostate cancer, which may be largely attributed to the widespread use of prostate specific antigen for early detection. Therefore, we support the suggestion that therapeutic gains might follow from improved education regarding the signs and symptoms associated with bladder cancer, with enhanced focus on women and consideration of screening methods for those at high risk for bladder cancer.",
    "Biopsy parameters such as Gleason pattern 4/5 carcinoma may provide adequate specificity for predicting clinically significant cancer, as defined by high grade Gleason patterns in the corresponding radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the accuracy of these parameters for predicting indolent cancer is limited by a prohibitive rate of false-negative findings.",
    "HCG therapy is valuable for identifying and treating nonpalpable testis. Using this agent enabled the testicle to be detected while avoiding the risks and cost associated with the laparoscopic procedure.",
    "Using PCA morphine consumption as parameter, we can distinguish the magnitude of pain intensity between 2 major orthopedic surgeries. The deeper and more extensive operation would in total hip replacement does not mean that it is a more painful procedure than total knee replacement. Several speculations are proposed.",
    "The finding that a relatively heavy work rate elicits the highest rate of fat oxidation in an active, female population has application in exercise prescription and refutes the belief that low-intensity exercise is preferred for fat metabolism.",
    "The prescribing patterns of some practising physicians were analyzed in terms of conformity with guidelines of combination of drugs and dosages. The use of antihypertensive combination therapy and the doses of individual drugs in combination regimens seem to be partly non-compliant with guidelines issued by WHO recommendations; this is illustrated by excessive prescription of some irrational combinations, as well as limited prescription of some rational combinations. In addition, a tendency to use high doses of certain classes of antihypertensive combinations was observed.",
    "In postmenopausal women with idiopathic macular holes, serum E2, LH, FSH bone metabolic markers and bone density are comparable to those found in women (of the same age group) free of macular holes. Women with macular holes are characterized by lower GH and IGF-1, which prompts further study.",
    "We conclude that there is an ethnic difference in the influence of smoking cessation on weight gain in MA and NHW. However, in both ethnic groups this effect is quite small and makes only a slight contribution to the overall increase in prevalence of obesity in this population.",
    "For neonates pretreated with HFV/iNO, an OI>40 is an inadequate ECMO indication. Based on our data we hypothesize that an OI>or = 25 after 72 h of HFV/ iNO is a better ECMO indication that avoids prolonged barotrauma.",
    "Screening mammography is associated with a decreased risk of detecting metastatic breast cancer among elderly women. Public health recommendations need to weigh the benefit of screening elderly women against the cost and potential harm from screening and treating early lesions that may have no effect on mortality.",
    "Although this study presents some limitations, like the use of reported weight and a standard value for physical activity, it shows that reported foods differed, quantitatively and qualitatively, between severe underreporters and non-underreporters. Underreporting of food intake does not result from a systematical underestimation of portion sizes for all food items, but seems to concern specific food items which are generally considered 'bad for health'.",
    "DPI values in patients with liver metastases differ from those in control subjects due to an increased hepatic arterial blood flow. No clear separation of the two groups was possible because DPI values overlapped. The inter observer agreement in DPI seems clinically acceptable.",
    "In this preliminary study, only complete embolization had an effect on blood loss. The value of preoperative embolization for all meningiomas must be reconsidered, especially in view of the high costs and risks of embolization.",
    "In our patient group 4.9% presented with metastases despite negative SLN while published data report up to 11% (observation period 35 months), among them only 3 patients (1.9%) being real concept failures. Our results underline that there is no evidence to change this concept in patients with clinically early stage.",
    "Although continuously or intermittently elevated transaminases do not always indicate morphologically advanced disease, the normal course of serum transaminases is mostly accompanied by normal, or near-normal, liver histology, in HCV-infected renal transplant patients. Liver biopsy is not indicated in deciding disease severity in these patients unless clinical findings dictate otherwise.",
    "FNA biopsy of testes in azoospermia is a fast, reliable and minimally traumatic method. The prospects for utilizing FNA biopsy material in assisted and microassisted fertilization are promising.",
    "Prevalence of problems, adoptive family characteristics, and adoption status must all be taken into account to understand why adoptees are more likely to receive counseling. Clinicians should be sensitive to issues that are especially salient in adoptive families.",
    "Broadly defined pervasive ADHD appears to be as heritable as ADHD behaviors defined by maternal reports alone. A common genetic factor influences maternally rated and teacher-rated ADHD but does not account for all of the genetic variance for teacher-rated ADHD. ADHD symptom scores are highly heritable, and maternal contrast effects appear to vary for different measures.",
    "For a differential diagnosis of AIP and BOOP, special attention should be given to the following HRCT findings: traction bronchiectasis, interlobular septal thickening, intralobular reticular opacities, parenchymal nodules, pleural effusion, and peripheral zone predominance.",
    "By redistributing some of the backpack effort, pole use alleviated some stress from the lower extremities and allowed a partial reversal of typical load-bearing strategies.",
    "Within a program of conservative treatment, progression of high-risk NMIBC was associated with a poor prognosis. Surveillance and bacillus Calmette-Guerin were ineffective in altering the natural history of this disease. The authors concluded that the time has come to rethink the paradigm of management of this disease.",
    "Rose Questionnaire as a simple screening tool is equally important to predict incident CHD in both genders. Adding abnormal ECG to angina did not culminate in higher risk for future CHD events.",
    "We found that a structured format for outpatient letters was better than unstructured format. This audit helped change the structure and consequently the readability scores of the clinic letters.",
    "In light of the fact that more than 80% of anxiety-disordered children never receive treatment, these data suggest that therapist-supported bibliotherapy represents a cost-effective means of reaching a greater number of anxious children.",
    "An early follow-up protocol consisting of an intraoperative completion angiogram, DUS, and abdominal radiograph shows a high sensitivity and NPV for the detection of endoleaks and should detect early migration or kinking of the stent-graft. An initial postoperative CTA is not necessary for most patients undergoing EVAR and should be reserved for those individuals in whom the aforementioned modalities are inconclusive or show signs of endoleak or other EVAR failure.",
    "About half of the patients with stage 3 CKD progressed to stage 4 or 5, as assessed by eGFR, over 10 years. Degree of albuminuria, stage 3 subgroup and microscopic haematuria were important risk factors for progression of stage 3 CKD. It would be appropriate to divide the present stage 3 CKD into two subgroups.",
    "Correlations among the study variables were negligible and negative. Hence, there is no apparent relationship between the variables.",
    "Electrocorticography-guided surgery was associated with excellent postsurgical outcome. Although this sample size was too small to detect a subtle difference, absence of epileptiform discharges on post-ECoG does not appear to predict seizure freedom in all pediatric patients referred for epilepsy surgery. Future studies with larger study samples would be necessary to confirm this finding and determine whether post-ECoG may be useful in some subsets of pediatric epilepsy surgery candidates.",
    "Measures based on assessment of symptoms showed no evidence of change over time. However, the frequency of diagnosis and treatment appears to be increasing and perceptions of extreme stress are decreasing. These changes probably reflect changes in diagnostic practice, mental health literacy, or willingness to report mental health concerns. However, no direct evidence of changing mental health status was found.",
    "Practices with high levels of deprivation and older patients have increased rates of recorded chronic disease. As the number of patients recorded with chronic disease increased, the capacity of practices to meet patients' requests for appointments in advance declined. The capacity of some practices to detect and manage chronic disease may need improving.",
    "Most patients with advanced progressive illnesses, especially those with non-malignant disease, are not being formally identified for a palliative care approach before they die. Those identified are more likely to benefit from coordinated care and may be more likely to die at home.",
    "In primarily bisphosphonate-naive women, we found no evidence that thick femoral cortices placed women at higher risk for low-energy S/D femur fractures; in fact, the opposite was true. Women with thin cortices were also at a higher risk for femoral neck and intertrochanteric fractures. Whether cortical thickness among bisphosphonate users plays a role in atypical S/D fractures remains to be determined.",
    "We concluded that histopathologic diagnosis may not be required for the patients without preoperative risk factors, particularly pediatric patients.",
    "It is quite possible to treat acute exacerbations of COPD efficiently and safely in a health centre hospital ward. New treatment modalities and health service structures seem to have led to a decrease in acute exacerbations of COPD since the year 2000, even though the number of patients with this disease has increased as a consequence of ageing of the population. Further research is required on the efficacy of treatment by a general practitioner, e.g., with data on re-hospitalization.",
    "Preventive interventions should be aimed at assisting primary caregivers with providing and obtaining adequate dental care for their children through enhancing oral health literacy, developing new set of oral health-related skills, reducing environmental constraints, and strengthening their intention of obtaining professional preventive dental services.",

    "Given that all modern diagnostic systems have been hierarchical, it is important to know that clinicians' thinking is also hierarchical.",
    "More attention is needed to develop rehabilitation interventions in supported housing programs to improve social integration of chronically homeless adults. Because improvements in some domains of social integration were only weakly related, it may be necessary to intervene in multiple domains simultaneously.",
    "Insufficiently treated hypertension or previously undiagnosed hypertension is relatively common in a physical medicine clinic. We therefore recommend the implementation of arterial blood pressure measurement into the admission procedures in order to reduce such events.",
    "Pulmonary rehabilitation is efficient in elderly patients with severe and very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and their compliance with pulmonary rehabilitation was similar to that seen in younger groups. Therefore, elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should not be denied pulmonary rehabilitation.",
    "Lateral pelvic LNs can be considered as regional LNs in low rectal cancer, although metastasis extending beyond the internal iliac area is associated with poorer survival.",
    "This is the first demonstration of alpha-synuclein in colon tissue prior to onset of PD. Additional study is required to determine whether colonic mucosal biopsy may be a biomarker of premotor PD.",
    "Further Canadian approaches to develop a system of Canadian prescribing indicators would enable federal/provincial/territorial and international comparisons, identify practice variations and highlight potential areas for improvement in prescribing, drug use and health outcomes across Canada. A more standardized system would facilitate cross-national research opportunities and enable Canada to examine how European countries use prescribing indicators, both within their country and across the European Union.",
    "When specimens are processed within 1 hour of collection, results of routine biochemical measurements of blood collected in lithium heparin tubes remain clinically valid for up to 11 months after expiration of tubes for the majority of analytes, except for ALP, lipase, fructosamine, and total CO(2).",
    "In conclusion, it was seen that the combination of the cytological examination with microsatellite analyses and cell-free DNA in pleural fluid could increase the sensitivity of the diagnosis in patients with PE who have a suspected malignancy, obviating the need for other invasive diagnostic procedures.",
    "Although the differences in dementia incidence were nonsignificant, our study suggests that dementia incidence has decreased between 1990 and 2005.",
    "Effusion in the middle ear induced by histamine is an appropriate medium for H. pylori reproduction and it also aggravates the inflammation process. In contrary, H. pylori did not cause inflammation in the normal middle ear. We suggest that H. pylori does not play a role in the etiology of otitis media with effusion alone, but it contributes to the inflammation process in the presence of an effusion.",
    "On the basis of second-trimester-specific guidelines, inadequate GWG can be predicted in underweight and normal-weight mothers, whereas excessive GWG can be predicted in overweight and obese mothers. Therefore, it appears possible to identify women at risk of gaining outside of the guideline as early as the second trimester.",
    "Despite some limits of our study, it appears that vulvar cancer management is often not conform to the French guidelines raising concerns on their insufficient diffusion and creation of expert centers.",
    "In a pilot study comparing the effectiveness of foam- and gauze-based NPWT systems, no statistically significant differences were found in patient wound healing, pain, length of stay, or cost of wound care. Nursing time and perceptions about the ease of preparing and completing dressing changes did not differ between systems. Additional research is needed to more definitively determine any differences in wound healing or nurse satisfaction using gauze- versus foam-based NPWT systems.",
    "Body mass index does not have an effect on serum AMH levels in women of reproductive age. Obesity has no association with levels of serum follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, prolactin and thyroid stimulating hormone. Obesity is unlikely to affect ovarian reserve in the premenopausal age group.",
    "In our study, previous quinolone use was significantly associated to first-line anti-TB drugs resistance. Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major problem worldwide, and we believe quinolones should be used with caution in settings where TB is endemic.",
    "Intravenous iron does not appear to reduce the blood transfusion requirements in the postoperative period of colorectal surgery patients with anemia. We consider that further studies are needed to more clearly define the usefulness of intravenous iron in reducing the transfusion needs in such patients.",
    "Rinses with edible oils have no significant impact on the initial pattern and amount of bacterial colonization on enamel over 8 h.",
    "Correction of larger curves was associated with increased utilization of perioperative health-care resources, specifically longer operative time, a greater number of vertebral levels instrumented, and higher odds of receiving a blood transfusion.",
    "Failure of fixation with recurrent widening of the pubic space can be expected after plating of the pubic symphysis for traumatic diastasis. Although widening may represent a benign condition as motion is restored to the pubic symphysis, patients should be counseled regarding a high risk of radiographic failure but a small likelihood of revision surgery.",
    "Our educational intervention facilitates compliance with vaginal dilators. Surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy (with or without cisplatin as a radiation sensitizer) may predict a lower risk of vaginal stenosis compared to definitive radiation therapy alone.",
    "Our data evaluating the use of ESA as a treatment of CIA in ovarian cancer patients are similar to reports in other tumor sites. Considering that patients who used ESA were more likely to experience recurrence and death and to have decreased survival, the use of ESA in ovarian cancer patients should be limited.",
    "We did find a relationship between the use of antibiotics and breakthrough pregnancy in a population-based prescription database. The results did not hold for broad-spectrum antibiotics or in a sensitivity analysis. The results are partly not the same as those found in a pharmacoepidemiological study with a similar design using two US pregnancy databases. Both studies can suffer from bias and confounding, but these will be different because of the use of different databases.",
    "In our study for the cone-beam machine and the acquisition parameters used, the threshold value of the 73 used in Dolphin 3D software was the most accurate to measure airway volume, but the threshold values of the 70, 71, 72, 74, and 75 had no statistically significant differences compared with the gold standard, showing they are also reliable.",
    "Urgency, frequency and nocturia triggered during pregnancy tend to disappear in the late postpartum period, regardless of the delivery method, but the symptoms related to urinary loss due to stress tend to persist in late postpartum period after vaginal delivery.",
    "This model accurately predicts the outcome of previous trials and demonstrates that even if lymph node dissection was therapeutic, these trials would have been negative due to study design. Furthermore, future trial designs that are being considered would need to be conducted in high-intermediate risk patients to detect any difference.",
    "The vast majority (98.5%) of women with low-lying or marginal placentas at the mid-pregnancy ultrasound examination had normally located placentas in the third trimester, and less than 1% of these women had a Caesarean section for reasons that could be associated with the placental location.",
    "Unlike hospital-based protocol-dependent systems, physician-dependent systems for antenatal anti-D prophylaxis remain subject to errors of omission. A more standardized system is needed to ensure effective antenatal prophylaxis.",
    "Two-thirds of HAART-failing children could benefit from CCR5 antagonists-based strategies, even in case of triple-class virologic failure. Such therapy should be discussed more appropriately at early stages of infection, when CCR5-tropic strains are most frequently isolated. However, before considering such strategies, further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and the tolerability of CCR5 antagonists in this pediatric population.",

    "Clear criteria to differentiate AH from NB are still missing. Despite spontaneous regression is thought to indirectly confirm a non neoplastic lesion, benign evolution has also been documented for NB. As histology is available only in operated or biopsied cases, we still lack a reliable set of signs for early differentiation and to reduce repeated, invasive investigations.",
    "Although the assumption of comparability underlying the relative survival method may not be reasonable, it does not have a concerning impact on the estimates of relative survival, as most lung cancer patients die within the first 2 years following diagnosis. This should serve to reassure critics of the use of relative survival when applied to lung cancer data.",
    "The British public appear to be aware that not all cancers are equally fatal.",
    "By adding PHH3 immunostain to the H&E, the agreement in grading the carcinomas among the 3 pathologists improved dramatically. PHH3 immunostain may play an important role in grading UTUC in small cell block samples.",

    "The findings demonstrate the need for a greater focus on recognizing depression among carers working in aged care facilities. Protocols should be developed to assist carers to detect, refer, and monitor depression in residents.",
    "Xenon light sources have the greatest illumination potential; however, at only 33% power level, potentially harmful temperatures can be reached at the tips of the endoscopes. Power LED and halogen have the highest safety; however, only LED has very good illumination. In narrow corridors, direct contact to tissues or vital structures should be avoided, or endoscopes should be cooled during surgical procedures.",
    "The ACE-R and MMSE total scores are highly correlated. In this clinical sample of people with established AD, for an MMSE score of 24, the predicted ACE-R score was 67.9 with 95% confidence intervals of 61.6-75.4. The extra non-MMSE ACE-R items improve estimates of cognitive ability by 16%.",

    "Being admitted to the medical ICU during morning rounds is not associated with a poorer outcome than afternoon and night admissions. The conditions of the patients admitted during morning rounds were more severe, which underlines the importance of the ICU team’s availability during this time. Further studies are needed to evaluate if the presence of a specific medical team overnight in the wards would be able to improve patients’ outcome by preventing delayed ICU admission.",
    "Although almost half of instructions mentioned reporting guidelines, their value in improving research publications is not being fully realised. Journals have a responsibility to support peer reviewers. We make several recommendations including wider reference to the EQUATOR Network online library (www.equator-network.org/).",
    "Despite the failure to identify a relationship between AD and the overall risk of cancer, we found that Taiwanese patients with AD had a higher risk of developing prostate cancer and a lower risk of developing cervical cancer.",
    "We conclude that the behavioral response towards carcasses depends largely on the nature of the carcasses and termite species, and the response is more complex than was previously thought. Such behavioral responses likely are associated with the threat posed to the colony by the carcasses and the feeding habits and nesting ecology of a given species.",
    "FT at FAST mode is not a valid test to detect differences in rhythm formation across the groups studied; fatigue is a confounding variable in some groups if the test is performed as fast as possible.",

    "The assumption that endometriosis is a disease of the premenopausal period and in women of reproductive age needs to be called into question, as well as the influence of estrogen in fully developed endometriosis. Due to the relatively high prevalence of the condition in patients aged over 40, physicians should consider endometriosis in cases of unclear pelvic pain in this age group.",
    "The novel method of privacy performance assessment realized in EUBIROD may improve the respect of privacy in each data source, reduce overall variability in the implementation of privacy principles and favour a sound and legitimate cross-border exchange of high quality data across Europe.",
    "Stress accuracy was consistently related to reading measures, even when PA and MA were not. Morphophonology involving suprasegmental factors may be an area of convergence between language varieties because of its consistent relationship to word reading.",
    "No significant disparity was found in the odds of Caesarean delivery between privately insured and Medicaid patients in Michigan after adjusting for other Caesarean risk factors. A positive disparity would have provided de facto evidence that financial incentives play a role in physician decision-making regarding Caesarean delivery.",
    "In this cohort of patients receiving ceftriaxone, doxycycline was associated with lower risk of CDI. Guidelines recommend this combination as a second-line regimen for some patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Further clinical studies would help define whether doxycycline-containing regimens should be a preferred therapy for CAP.",

    "The use of 10% carbamide peroxide prior to bonding orthodontic metallic brackets does not significantly alter shear bond strength. Application of desensitizer agent alone or in combination with bleaching agent significantly lowers the shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets. Application of desensitizer agent alone or in combination with bleaching agent does not lower the shear bond strength below the recommended value for orthodontic bonding procedure. As a result, their use is not a contraindication before orthodontic fixed mechanotherapy.",

    "Straight-leg swaddling was demonstrated to increase the prevalence of developmental dysplasia of the hip in this animal model, especially if the swaddling was early or prolonged. The severity of hip impairment varied, with early and prolonged swaddling both leading to more dislocations than subluxations. Sex differences also existed but a side preference was not observed. Appositional growth of acetabular cartilage and a deformed triradiate cartilage complex were the pathological basis of the hip dysplasia in this animal model.",

The residents handle off-hours cases with a radiology-detected error rate below the error rate between ABR-certified radiologists. To decrease the perceived clinician-identified error rate, we need to change how academic radiology handles ED cases.",
    "Aggressive pancreatic resection for PNET can be performed with low perioperative mortality and morbidity. Unlike available nonoperative therapy, this approach offers an excellent means of symptomatic palliation and local disease control. In patients with malignant PNET, metastatic recurrence is not uncommon and will usually require additional multimodality therapy. When possible, an aggressive approach to PNET is justified to optimize palliation and survival.",

    "There has been a clear switch from hospital to community psychiatric care in Brazil, where the system can now provide a diversity of treatments and free access to psychotropics. However, the coverage of community services is precarious, and the reform was not accompanied by an increased public investment in mental health. The psychiatric reform is not a strategy for reducing costs; it necessarily implies increasing investments if countries decide to have a better care of those more disadvantaged.",

    "Although in extensive use, the syndromic approach is unsuitable for diagnosing cervical infections in antenatal care attendees in Botswana. None of the evaluated risk scores can replace this management. Without diagnostic tests, there are no adequate management strategies for C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae in pregnant women in Botswana, a situation which is likely to apply to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Screening for cervical infections in pregnant women is an essential public health measure, and rapid tests will hopefully be available in developing countries within a few years.",
    "The PGA external extent contributes little to the reduction of the mechanical mismatch between the graft and its host artery while remodeling develops. For the geometric mismatch, it reduces the cross-section area, therefore matching with the host artery much better. Although there are some positive effects, conclusively the PGA is not an ideal material for external stent.",

This finding is important for settings where mifepristone remains unavailable. Additional factors such as gestational age limits and patient preference should be considered in regimen selection.",
    "Based on these relationships and the nature of the chronic inflammation we conclude that the lesions were likely a result of recurrent infections and ageing but that long-term exposure to mercury could not be excluded as a co-factor. The information is important as it is likely that tropospheric mercury depletion events will continue to increase the concentrations of this toxic heavy metal in the Sub Arctic and Arctic marine food webs.",

Moreover, this finding concurs with results obtained in white Americans and Europeans.",
    "PSA is a well-established tumor marker of prostatic adenocarcinoma. It is also shown to be produced by extraprostatic tissues and fluids. As the gene expression of PSA is upregulated by the androgens and progestins in hormonally responsive tissues, hyperandrogenic syndromes such as PCOS may be associated with elevated serum PSA levels. PSA appears to be a promising marker of endogenous androgen excess in females suffering from PCOS.",
    "In this clinical outpatient sample, the association between panic disorder and suicidal behavior was primarily explained by comorbidity with depressive disorders. No differences were observed between different groups for measures of severity of the suicidal behavior. Physicians should be aware of these associations when assessing adults with panic disorder for suicidality.",

    "Long latencies for PTSD are a typical feature in psychogeriatrics, possibly due to the situation in post-war-Germany probably even more in the Soviet occupied zone, the later German Democratic Republic (GDR). In the GDR it was not at all a public topic to speak about Russian violence (political taboo). The depressive and psychotic comorbidity of psychogeriatric PTSD-patients should be examined more specifically in future studies.",

    "Malaria control strategies should be designed to fit the local context. The heterogeneity of transmission should be assessed at the district level to allow cost-effective resource allocation that gives priority to locations with high risk. Functional routine health information systems could provide the necessary data for context specific risk assessment.",
    "This prospective study has found a relationship between bacterial colonisation of the tonsillar fossa and post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage. This suggests that there may be an argument for the use of antibiotics in those cases with positive pre-operative cultures. In view of the types of pathogens isolated, we feel that the management of a post-tonsillectomy bleed should include a beta lactamase inhibiting antibiotic.",
    "The numerous demographic, clinical, and psychopathological overlapping characteristics in unipolar and bipolar mania raise questions about the general nosographic utility of this categorization.

    "Excessive tearfulness could be a useful clinical sign of cocaine-induced depression.",
    "The type, the number, and the combinations of cardiovascular risk factors and the predictors for adverse outcome are different in the 2 age groups. Our observations indicate that people 75 years or older with small number of cardiovascular risk factors can undergo CEA with the same risk of perioperative stroke and death as the younger patients.",
    "Lower pole anatomy as a risk factor for stones depends on the type of measurement used. A consensus should be reached to define how exactly the IPA should be measured. Other anatomic factors were not significantly different between the affected and normal side in our study.",
    "All 12 models had excellent discrimination and calibration, with 8 of 12 meeting prespecified performance criteria (AUC>or =0.8, mean absolute error<or =0.4).

    "Cognitive performance affects NRP in elderly HF patients. Specific rehabilitative approaches, according to baseline cognitive performance, should be considered.",
    "Men with a low cardiovascular risk score and the metabolic syndrome had a significantly higher risk of fatal CVD than those without the syndrome. The use of the metabolic syndrome in clinical practice is thus justified in men, but waist circumference provided a simpler diagnostic tool with similar fatal CVD risk in these low-risk men. A large waist circumference could be used for prescreening, and could be included in CVD risk scores.",

    "The estimated odds ratio showed that none of the associated variables including presence of any degree of epithelial dysplasia in the whole lesion, site, demarcation and smoking had influence on the risk of malignant development.",
    "Religiosity was not protective against substance use in sexual minority young adults, cautioning against over-generalizing previous findings about the protective effects of religiosity. Future studies that 1) consider the social context for sexual identity development, 2) model both risk and protective factors, and 3) use multidimensional measures of religiosity (and spirituality) and sexual identity are needed to build the necessary knowledge base for effective health promotion efforts among sexual minority youth and young adults.",

Because the results for palpation and MRI are almost equal, MRI should only be reserved for specific cases, and not routinely requested.",
    "After breast-conserving surgery, the concurrent use of chemotherapy with radiotherapy is significantly associated with greater differences between the breasts. These differences do not translate into patients' lessened satisfaction with cosmesis.",
    "Non-randomised letters and non-randomised lens progression on their own did not affect the subjective amplitude of accommodation as measured by defocus curves, although their combination should be avoided.",
    "Given the choice, most patients would choose intraoperative diagnosis, though a minority would explicitly not, due to the adverse psychological effect thereof. Despite a good understanding of the procedure, the majority of patients overestimate the sensitivity of intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel nodes, which may heighten disappointment when a false negative diagnosis occurs. Intraoperative diagnosis should not be the automatic choice and patients should be actively involved in this decision making process.",
    "In elderly women, revascularization procedures can be done with acceptable mortality rates; but these patients are still associated with a higher prevalence of postoperative morbidity when compared with the male counterparts. Therefore, these patients have to be very carefully evaluated preoperatively and their postoperative care should be more comprehensive to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications.",
    "Our data show that pulmonary annular growth after patch repair of subarterial ventricular septal defect is suboptimal compared with perimembranous ventricular septal defect. Careful attention must be paid to the possible late clinical implication caused by impaired pulmonary annular growth after patch repair of subarterial ventricular septal defect.",
    "The overall incidence of sudden death in children awaiting heart transplantation is low; therefore, uniform implantation of ICDs for the primary prevention of sudden death is unlikely to improve survival in this population.

Psychiatric disorders are much more likely to develop after the onset of the work injury, indicating that such injuries and accompanying stressors are likely to be precipitants, rather than consequences, of psychopathology.",
    "We examine the ethical considerations for and against placebo therapy, and explore the role of placebo therapy in the management of psychogenic movement disorders.",
    "On conventional MRI, epidermoid-dermoid and arachnoid cysts have similar signal characteristics. Initial experience with spine DW imaging shows promise in differentiating epidermoid-dermoid cysts from arachnoid cysts. Preoperative differentiation is important because it changes management and surgical approach.",

    "Overall sexual function of men was not affected by their partner's parity and mode of delivery. An elective cesarean section simply because of concerns about sexual function would not provide additional benefit to men, and could deny women a possible vaginal delivery, which is generally assumed to be safer than cesarean section.",

This suggests that clinical variables, such as hypertension or diabetes, seem to affect treatment decisions equally for whites and blacks. Previously described racial disparities in care are unlikely to be an artifact of misspecified models.",
    "In this first study comparing double- and single-row anchorage techniques, we found no significant difference in clinical results, but tendon healing rates were better with the double-row anchorage.

    "These findings indicate that very elderly individuals tended to receive care within LTC settings, with care that might be considered aggressive declining with increasing age. However, health care use among all age groups was substantial. A critical issue that needs to be examined in future research is how to ensure quality end-of-life care in a variety of clinical contexts and care settings for individuals of all ages.",

    "Beta-blocker-based antihypertensive therapy significantly reduces cardiovascular risk in hypertension compared with placebo or no treatment. Atenolol was an appropriate comparator in the LIFE study. As the results of the LIFE study and other recent trials demonstrate superiority of newer agents over atenolol, this agent is not an appropriate reference drug for future trials of cardiovascular risk in hypertension.",
    "These findings support the argument that functional organization in children may differ from that in adults, suggesting that multiple cerebral regions, or a diffuse cerebral network, may mediate children's executive functions (EF). Results are also consistent with the hypothesis that the amount of damaged brain tissue, rather than its location, may be more predictive of neurobehavioural outcome following early TBI.",

    "The findings support the existence of a relationship between sensory light touch thresholds tested by the Semmes Weinstein monofilaments (SWMs) and hand function. However, the SWM test alone is not sufficient as an indicator of hand function and must therefore be supplemented with other hand function tests.",
    "Asthma mortality in southern Brazil remains low and appears to be decreasing after reaching a peak in the mid-1990s. The reason for these trends remains unknown.",
    "Generally, demand pattern analysis estimated or overestimated call volume, making it a reasonable predictor for ambulance staffing patterns. However, it did underestimate call volume between 4% and 7% of the time. Communities need to determine if these rates of over-and underestimation are acceptable given their resources and local priorities.",
    "The results of this preliminary study suggest that ambulances operating in the emergency medical services (EMS) system may have a significant degree of MRSA contamination and may represent an important reservoir in the transmission of potentially serious infections to patients.",

    "In working populations survey non-response does not seriously bias analyses of social class inequalities in sickness absence and possibly health inequalities more generally.",
    "In this series, although MFES was effective in the short term, the long-term treatment outcome was unsatisfactory. A critical review suggests that outcome success is proportional to the patient's ability and willingness to accept quite a high stimulation intensity or, alternatively, follow-up home treatment. Hence, the implementation of strict primary as well as secondary selection criteria can hopefully identify patients most suitable for MFES. Another lesson to be learnt is that the identification of crucial prerequisites of successful treatment is mandatory before embarking on controlled studies.",
    "Compared to the literature, the studied population shows a lower rate of psychiatric problems and pharmacological treatment. This might reflect underrecognition or undertreatment.",
    "Due to the difficulties in attaining reliable assessment of quality of life using psychometric questionnaires, the further proof of validity obtained in this study allows us to propose the re-evaluation of the role of the uniscale in measuring the quality of life of cancer patients.",
    "We were able to analyze only a limited number of executions. However, our findings suggest that current lethal injection protocols may not reliably effect death through the mechanisms intended, indicating a failure of design and implementation. If thiopental and potassium chloride fail to cause anesthesia and cardiac arrest, potentially aware inmates could die through pancuronium-induced asphyxiation. Thus the conventional view of lethal injection leading to an invariably peaceful and painless death is questionable.",
    "Concern about health, belief about modern medicine and CAM are logically inter-related. Those who have high MHWs tend to be more sceptical about modern medicine and more convinced of the possible role of psychological factors in personal health and illness.",
    "We found that children born after assisted conception had a lower risk of developing infantile autism then their matched controls. Our observations could possibly be explained by the mother's health status before and during early pregnancy. Our findings require further investigation in larger studies.",

    "Increased utilization of bariatric surgery in Florida is associated with overall favorable short-term outcomes. Older age and male gender were associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Surgeon and hospital procedure volume have an inverse relationship with in-hospital complications and mortality.",
    "This study provides the best evidence for both the increasing use and the associated risks of LE versus SR. For each individual patient, the benefits of LE must be balanced against the heightened risk of local failure.",
    "Early traumatic coagulopathy occurs only in the presence of tissue hypoperfusion and appears to occur without significant consumption of coagulation factors. Alterations in the thrombomodulin-protein C pathway are consistent with activated protein C activation and systemic anticoagulation. Admission plasma thrombomodulin and protein C levels are predictive of clinical outcomes following major trauma.",

    "This finding, jointly with those of a previous experiment which showed no AM effect on blind subjects (Olivetti Belardinelli&Santangelo 2005) supports the idea of different spatial maps underlying visual and auditory attention, and suggests that their co-existence may induce interference effects in space processing, giving rise to the anisotropic representation of visual and auditory spaces, observed in normal subjects.",
    "MRC in conjunction with barium-based fecal tagging led to diagnostic image quality in 95% of all colonic segments. Since tagging results were significantly decreased in patients>or =55 years, tagging protocols should to be modified in this group, i.e., by increasing the time interval of tagging administration.",
    "Visual impairment does not appear to be particularly prevalent in RA, obviating the need for a screening programme. Utilization of the VFQ-25 as a screening tool in RA requires further consideration. The high prevalence of cataracts in participants on steroids emphasizes the need to prescribe the minimum required dose. The high prevalence of dry eyes suggests that a Schirmer's test should be performed regularly, with prescription of artificial tears if required.",

    "The functional status of patients without prior symptoms of heart disease is similar in Americans and Canadians. However, among patients with previous symptomatic heart disease, functional status is higher in Americans than in Canadians. This difference may be due to different patterns of medical management of heart disease in the two countries.",
    "We conclude that the early phase of hypertension is characterized by centripetal distribution of intravascular volume, leading to an increased preload to the left ventricle. This change in volume status appears to be related to cardiac structural adaptation to an increase in arterial pressure.",

    "Drug treatment for mild-to-moderate hypertension in middle-aged patients may reduce all-cause mortality and the risk of fatal coronary events when treatment is initiated in those beyond a certain baseline mortality risk. Drug treatment in hypertensive patients at a lower mortality risk has no influence on or may even increase mortality.",
    "Discontinuing inhaled steroids is possible in some patients with asthma or COPD after 2 years of regular treatment. This might indicate that for certain groups of patients with mild asthma or COPD, periodic treatment schedules with inhaled steroids is the treatment policy for the future.",

    "These data show that 86% (37/43) of the ulcers has some degree of reflux in the local area, the pattern of which may differ from the axial vein disease. Treatment of the local hemodynamic abnormalities may be an important factor in the healing of the ulcers and in the prevention of their recurrence.",
    "These data show that the Stroke Belt continues to exist for blacks and whites and for men and women. Although the specific causes of the Stroke Belt remain unknown, the public health impact is staggering, with a greater than 40% excess risk of stroke mortality and more than 1200 excess stroke deaths annually.",
    "Diagnosis of nonhemorrhagic infarct can be made in 36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 43) of patients with a high level of accuracy (100% in the external validity study, which gives a 95% CI of 93 to 100). Thus, 43% (95% CI, 36 to 50) of patients with a nonhemorrhagic infarct could receive a bedside diagnosis. The score is simple and can be calculated from information available to all physicians.",

    "It was found that the distribution of the known risk factors among the study group was practically the same as those in the non-Jewish population. Moreover, it was found that there was an increase of 29.2% (from 17/1000 to 24/1000) in the prevalence of cervical premalignant lesions among the Israeli women. We believe that this population can no longer be considered as being at low risk for this disease.",
    "The effects of disability and social support differ among non-Latino White and Latino elderly people. Latino elderly people with high anticipated needs obtain less paid assistance than similar non-Latino Whites. In addition to a reduction in financial barriers, improving access to long-term care services requires addressing this diversity in service use patterns.",
    "These results indicate that early treatment with lidocaine attenuates endotoxin-induced lung edema in rabbits without affecting chemical mediators in BALF. However, the improvement is slight and likely to be of little clinical significance.",
    "In contrast, comparing swim-up to the ejaculate, the percentage of matured nuclei (unstained spermatozoa) retrieved following swim-up was significantly lower (P<0.005). Glass-wool filtration separates human spermatozoa according to motility and size of the sperm head. The size of the sperm head closely correlated with the chromatin condensation quality.",
    "Electromanometric examinations showed that internal sphincterotomy significantly reduces pressure within the anal canal, thus permitting the anal fissure to heal. No significant continence problems were observed. Although manometric selection of patients leads to different results regarding both postoperative continence and recurrence, these differences are not statistically significant. Therefore, it follows that, in experienced hands and using a standardized technique, manometry before surgical management of anal fissure by lateral sphincterotomy is probably superfluous.",
    "In light of recent clinical reports and this experimental study, the ritual of mechanical bowel preparation should be further scrutinized.",

    "It is necessary to distinguish morphologically a cleft in an otherwise normally structured mitral valve in hearts with separate right and left AV junctions from the trifoliate left component of a common AV valve in hearts with an AV septal defect and a common AV junction because the disposition of the AV conduction tissues varies markedly between the lesions.",
    "The intraocular pressure measured in the usual manner after excimer-laser PRK is lower than the temporally measured pressure. These differences could be caused by absence of the Bowman's membrane, thinning of the cornea and/or change of its topography.",
    "Like low-volume supraglottic and T3 glottic carcinomas, T2 glottic squamous cell carcinoma is likely (82%) to be controlled with definitive radiation therapy. Failure to control the primary tumor is attributable to factors other than volume, which may not be detectable on CT, such as tumor-host biological factors. Pretreatment CT, however, is beneficial for detecting submucosal spread across the ventricle and subglottic extension, which might contraindicate vertical hemilaryngectomy and might not be apparent on endoscopic examination.",
    "Among cardiologists with a interest in electrocardiography and cardiac arrhythmias, apart of sinus bradycardia, there is no clear consensus concerning to the group of criteria to identify vagotonia in the standard 12-lead ECG.

    "Our data suggest that low pHi during the first 24 hours from trauma seems to be a good predictor for the development of organ failure.",
    "While most clinicians inquire about their patients' smoking status and recommend they quit, there currently exists a deficiency in the translation of these recommendations into concise, explicit instructions on how to quit. By increasing the frequency of clinicians giving specific advice about how to quit, the overall success rate of the public health campaign against tobacco use will be greatly enhanced.",
    "Frozen section evaluation is of minimal diagnostic value for follicular thyroid lesions, rendering no additional information 87% of the time; it prolongs the operation, increases costs, and leads to misguided interventions. Until a more definitive diagnostic tool exists for follicular thyroid lesions, FS evaluation could be omitted, resection of the lobe with the nodule could be performed, and the definitive operative management could be based on the final permanent histology.",
    "Properties of the \"soil\" into which embryos implant determines the likelihood of success or failure (abortion). Abnormal pre-implantation embryos can be \"rescued\" by \"good soil\"; \"sick soil\" damages both normal and abnormal embryos. Defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms may be useful in understanding basic mechanisms leading to aborting and nonaborting pregnancy.",
    "Reducing the volume of general practitioners' diagnostic tests through feedback does not lead to more specialist referrals. Together with lower test use, fewer hospital referrals were seen.",
    "Training practices are not only more developed than non-training practices but are also more innovative. The gap between training and non-training practices did grow wider between 1982 and 1990. This may be because the members of training practices are inherently more innovative, face fewer obstacles to innovation or that the scheme for approval of practices for training has encouraged specific innovations. Any future accreditation scheme for general practices must be organized to encourage accelerated development in less developed practices rather than only stimulate innovation in already advanced practices.",
    "The incidence of CIN is low when MMCT is used routinely to assess acute stroke patients. In this population, CIN was a biochemical phenomenon that did not have clinical manifestations, cause chronic kidney disease, require dialysis, or negatively impact on 90-day mRS outcomes. Renal profiling and waiting for a baseline serum-creatinine are an unnecessary delay to emergency reperfusion treatment.",
    "Prehospital advanced airway management via LT provides similar outcomes to those of LM in OHCA patients.",

    "Between 2005 and 2009 alcohol consumption strongly decreased among high school students. This may be due to the national prevention campaign which in the same period highlighted the importance of not drinking before the age of 16. The decrease in smoking and cannabis use between 2005 and 2009 may be due to clustering with alcohol consumption. A reduction in the use of alcohol in adolescence did not lead to replacement by tobacco or cannabis use.",
    "Our results suggest that visual assessment of aortic valve calcium has high interobserver variability; the visual ability to determine severe aortic stenosis has low sensitivity but high specificity. Our results may have important implications for treatment of patients with aortic stenosis and guiding the use of handheld echocardiography. Further research with larger cohorts is needed to validate the variability, sensitivity, and specificity reported in our study.",
    "In men with a serum prostate specific antigen less than 0.1 ng/ml after radical prostatectomy a tenfold lower cutoff (0.01 ng/ml) stratified biochemical recurrence-free survival and was a significant independent predictor of biochemical recurrence, as were pathological features. Prostate specific antigen concentrations in men without pathological evidence of prostate cancer suggest that a higher prostate specific antigen concentration (0.03 ng/ml) in the ultrasensitive range may be needed to define the detection threshold.",

    "Use of a simple self-rating scale of vocal loudness and talkativeness during history taking can reliably orient the examiner to the types of voice disorders likely to be diagnosed subsequently during vocal capability testing and visual laryngeal examination. The high degree of talkativeness and loudness seen in vocal overdoers correlates well with mucosal disorders such as nodules, polyps, capillary ectasia, epidermoid inclusion cysts, and hemorrhage. A lower degree of talkativeness correlates with muscle deconditioning disorders such as vocal fold bowing, atrophy, presbyphonia, and vocal fatigue syndrome.",
    "In the present study, sub-SMAS facelift complication rates were not statistically different compared to those of subcutaneous facelift with or without SMAS plication. These data suggest that sub-SMAS dissection can be performed with similar safety compared to the traditional subcutaneous facelift, with the potential additional advantage of the SMAS flap elevation.",

    "Based on midline measurements, the left ureter courses 2 to 4 mm more lateral and anterior than does the right ureter. The cervix is also positioned 2 to 4 mm to the left side, and as a result, the ureters are actually symmetric to the cervix. Although seemingly small, 2 to 4 mm is the width range of a Heaney clamp. These anatomic differences may be a contributing factor to the increase in ureteral injuries on the left side compared with the right.",

Among the assembly strategies, we find that overlapping paired-end reads is not always beneficial for bacteria genome assembly and should be avoided or used with caution especially for genomes containing high fraction of repetitive sequences. Because increasing numbers of projects aim at bacteria genome sequencing, our study provides valuable suggestions for the field of genomic sequence construction.",
    "Regarding diagnostic yield, complication rate, and biopsy-related mortality, there seems to be no difference between the frameless biopsy technique from Medtronic and BrainLAB®.

Thus, the issue of choice involves not the results, but the familiarity, end-user friendliness, and overall comfort when operating the system.",
    "VFs of eyes treated in the first half of the decade deteriorated more rapidly than those in the second half. Several factors might explain these differences but average effects were small and there was no reduction in the proportion of rapidly progressing eyes over the decade. Older age and, to a lesser extent, worse VF damage at diagnosis are indicators for faster VF loss in clinics, but frequency of VF testing was similar for all patients.",

    "The results based on this analysis indicate that patients with neurological diseases derive benefit from WMR only if their empirical RTW prognosis is poor. However, this only applies for the mental health in the medium term. Our study confirms the previous findings that suggest different effectiveness of the WMR for patients with different RTW risk.",
    "Change in adiposity from youth to adulthood predicted adult MHO better than youth adiposity alone.",
    "Asymptomatic patients discharged with lower Hgb levels did not manifest inferior outcomes, including perioperative morbidity/mortality, readmission<30 days, HRQL, and 1-year survival. The practice of blood transfusion to correct lower Hgb levels in asymptomatic patients should be eliminated, as it may be associated with increased morbidity without apparent clinical benefits after valve surgery.",
    "Help-seeking for nodding syndrome is pluralistic and include use of traditional and biomedical practices. Western medicines admittedly showed at least short term control on nodding syndrome symptoms, especially convulsions and led in a few cases to regain of functional abilities. However, multiple barriers hinder health seeking and interfere with adherence to biomedical treatments. Regarding cure, there are hitherto no treatments participants perceive cure nodding syndrome.",
    "In a high-volume TAVR center, transition to MA-TAVR is feasible with acceptable outcomes and a diminutive procedural learning curve. We advocate for TAVR centers to actively pursue the minimalist technique with equal representation by cardiologists and surgeons.",
    "This study showed basic arthroscopic skills did not immediately transfer to an unfamiliar anatomical environment within a simulated setting. These findings have important clinical implications with regard to surgical training as they potentially challenge the assumption that arthroscopic skills acquired in one joint are universally transferrable to other joints. Future orthopaedic simulation training should aim to deliver exposure to a greater variety of arthroscopic procedures and joint environments. This would allow trainees to become familiar with the different arthroscopic setting before undertaking real surgery and consequently improve patient safety.",
    "Patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis reported significant pain relief and gain in function as well as quality of life 6 months after localized PRP treatment. A single PRP injection may be sufficient.",
    "French neurology residents seemed satisfied with the structure and quality of their training program. However, efforts are required to improve management of the doctoral thesis and make private practice more attractive and accessible during the residency. In the future, similar surveys should be scheduled to regularly assess neurology residents' satisfaction and the impact of the forthcoming national and European reforms.",
    "The placement of a Frost suture in the setting of periorbital surgery, while often routine, lacks strong empirical evidence. This traditional practice involves consistent and specialized follow-up, impedes adequate clinical evaluation in the immediate postoperative period, and leads to considerable patient discomfort without proven therapeutic gain.",
    "For injured riders, ATVs are associated with increased mortality and higher resource utilisation compared to ORMCs. Both groups suffer distinct anatomic injuries, suggesting the need for focused areas of injury prevention planning and research.",
    "The rate of significant thyroid cancer found unexpectedly in resected goiters is extremely low. A negative FNA excludes significant cancer with near certainty.",

    "We revealed an important role of autophagy in thyroid carcinogenesis, as evidenced by the high rate of BECN1 immunoreactivity in PTC and FC. Moreover, we found that autophagy plays a more important role in PTC, as evidenced by the high immunoreactivity rates. According to our results, BECN1 is a more specific marker than HBME-1 in PTC and has a higher correlation with Ki-67. In routine studies, BECN1 will be more helpful than HBME-1 in the diagnosis of PTC.",
    "Results for focal seizures are in accordance with the literature, and detection of generalized seizures is improved after including respiratory information.",
    "Compared with adolescent women who had just delivered and did not have a prior abortion, women who had just delivered and had a previous abortion were more likely to be older at the age of their first pregnancy and more likely to initiate early prenatal care. Thus, having a prior abortion may improve the health of a pregnancy though adverse outcomes do not differ between the 2 groups.",
    "The durability of bioprosthetic valves in the pulmonary position was acceptable in patients aged ≥20 years, regardless of the z-score of valve size. However, patients who were children and adolescents did not show optimal durability of the bioprosthetic valve, irrespective of the z-score of valve size.",

    "Memory and executive functions in patients with OCD could not predict outcome of CBT, but level of social functioning may be a predictor of CBT outcome. Some of the main clinical implications are that we cannot use memory and executive functions, or baseline severity of OCD symptoms to determine which patients should be offered CBT.",
    "Our data suggested that MSCC may be a separate clinical entity like extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas (EPSCCs). Despite, multimodal treatment is currently the main treatment option, but for patients with LD MSCC, chemoradiotherapy is recommended to be preferred treatment modality.",

    "This study suggests that PAO may alter the GAG content of the articular cartilage with a greater effect on the superficial zone compared with the deeper acetabular cartilage zone, especially at the superior aspect of the joint. Some surgeons have observed that surgery itself can be a stressor that can accelerate joint degeneration. Perhaps the decrease in dGEMRIC index seen in the superficial layer may be a catabolic response to postsurgical inflammation given that some recovery was seen at 2 years. The decrease in dGEMRIC index in the deep layer seen mainly near the superior part of the joint is persistent and may represent a response of articular cartilage to normalization of increased mechanical load seen in this region after osteotomy, which may be a normal response to alteration in loading.",
    "Response to UMEC/VI, UMEC and VI in terms of trough FEV1, dyspnoea and health-related quality of life was similar for COPD patients with baseline EOS counts ≥ 2 or<2%. EOS count did not appear to predict bronchodilator response in either ICS users or non-users.",
    "Our results highlight the relevance of cannabis use compared to other potential predictors of the progression of tobacco use and thereby support the reverse gateway hypothesis.",

    "The results of our cohort analysis suggest that previous Cesarean section does not cause an increased risk of stillbirth.",
    "After cochlear implantation, children with Pendred syndrome performed better than the reference group with respect to speech perception, however, adults performed similar. No significant differences were found between the Pendred and EVA group. Consequently, during pre-operative counselling, the two groups of patients may be considered comparable in terms of expected speech perception performance after cochlear implantation.",
    "Obesity onset during early adolescence increased risk of high school dropout. White adolescents were particularly vulnerable. Given that early adolescence is marked by significant biological and social changes, future research should seek to identify the underlying processes linking adolescent obesity and school dropout to decrease school dropout risk among this vulnerable population.",
    "Perceived unfairness is related to impulsivity in patients with alcohol dependence. These results provide insights concerning the psychopathology of alcohol dependence.",

    "Among prostate cancer-free men about to begin a statin, pre-statin total cholesterol and LDL were correlated with PSA levels in white, but not black men. If confirmed in future studies, these findings suggest that serum cholesterol may be related to prostate biology, and that this effect may vary by race.",
    "The rate of Oxygen prescription improves significantly after an educational intervention; however, this improvement is not sustained. This observation is likely reflected in a range of areas where the audit cycle is used to improve performance.

    "Surgical resection of G-HCC provides OS comparable with that after resection of S-HCC.",
    "This study demonstrated the internal construct validity and reliability of the BBS-PD as a measurement tool for patients with PD within the Rasch analysis framework. However, the lack of items critical to the assessment of postural control impairments typical of PD, affected negatively the targeting, so that a significant percentage of patients was located in the higher ability range of the measurement continuum, where precision of measurement is reduced.",

    "The MAPS-Mini environment measure is short enough to be practical for use by community groups and planning agencies and is a valid substitute for the full version that is 8 times longer.",
    "These divergent dynamics support earlier work that suggested drivers of virulence may differ in fundamental ways between malaria species that are reticulocyte-specific and those that readily infect all red blood cell stages which should be studied in greater detail. The effect sizes (magnitude of biological effects) from these analyses are significant, and suggest the potential for important gains in malaria control by greater incorporation of evolutionary epidemiology theory. Moreover, we suggest that using these epidemiological models may generally allow fuller use of data from experimentally challenging animal model experiments.",
    "A substantial effect of financial incentives on adherence to LAIs occurs within the first 3 months of the intervention and is sustained over 1 year. A higher total amount of incentives does not increase the effect.",
    "The NCSP, which reduced out-of-pocket payment, may not decrease absolute gap although it leads to overall increases in the uptake of cancer screening and decreases in relative inequalities. Further investigations are needed to understand barriers that prevent the low-income population from attending cancer screening.",

    "Curcumin can prevent the formation of cholesterol gallstones induced by high fat diet in mice and SREBP2 and NPC1L1 may participate in this process. Piperine can increase curcumin's bioavailability, thereby enhancing the effect of curcumin.",
    "The end-of-life protocol seems effective in realizing adequate patient comfort. Most patients in whom life-sustaining measures are withdrawn are well sedated and show few signs of distress. Dosages of opioids and sedatives increase significantly during treatment withdrawal but do not contribute to time until death. Dying with a minimum of distressing signs is thus practically possible and ethically feasible.",
    "Most extrahepatic shunts can be identified on DSA prior to Y-90 therapy. However, SPECT-CT data helps to identify additional shunts that were initially not seen on DSA.",

    "Endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty is an alternative surgical approach to traditional technique. This surgery is more conservative than microscopic approach and can be performed in all pediatric cases independently from age. Moreover, it offers comparable anatomical and functional results to the traditional surgery, and grants better comfort for the child.",
    "There was a tendency for patients without MCs to have better outcomes but this did not reach statistical significance. The reliability of diagnosing MCs was substantial.",
    "Reagent-coagulometer combination has adequate sensitivities to factor deficiencies according to guideline recommendations (>30 IU/dL). These should not be considered as actual sensitivities because those obtained by analysing patients' plasmas with single-factor deficiencies were higher for most factors and could induce misinterpretation of the basic coagulation test results.",
    "Approximately half of deaths in acute pancreatitis occur within the first 14 d owing to organ failure and the remainder of deaths occur later because of complications associated with necrotizing pancreatitis. Improvement in mortality in the future will require innovative approaches to counteract early organ failure and late complications of necrotizing pancreatitis.",
    "As they are associated with only a low risk of predisposition to schizophrenia, cognitive markers may not be of immediate value in the prevention of schizophrenia when compared with the less specific markers used for this purpose. However, it would seem that their study will be necessary if the nature of the genetic transmission of the illness is to be understood. This understanding could be expected to ultimately lead to more effective prevention.",
    "Explicit guidelines do improve clinical practice, when introduced and monitored in the context of rigorous evaluations. However, the size of improvement could vary.",
    "We conclude that initial GCS score may be predictive of long-term outcome in patients with CT scan evidence of iTBH-a relationship to be explored further for prognostic information.",
    "The diagnostic information provided by the radiological examinations is comparable to that of clinical and instrumental methods currently employed for staging of rectal carcinoma, although the latter are preferred because they are more readily accessible and less costly. DCBE and CT can therefore be usefully employed for staging of cancer of the rectum in those cases in which there are limitations of the current standard methods.",
    "This study establishes that, under certain realistic conditions, CAHPS ratings could affect consumer selection of health plans and ultimately contain costs. Other studies are needed to learn how to enhance exposure and use of CAHPS information in the real world as well as to identify other conditions in which CAHPS ratings could make a difference.",

    "In a large population of elderly patients with AMI, we found significant treatment differences but no significant incremental mortality benefit associated with treatment by cardiologists.",
    "Instrumental variables estimation indicates that added outpatient therapy improves functioning among children and adolescents. The effect is statistically significant and of moderate practical magnitude. These results imply that conventional analyses of the dose-response relationship may understate the impact of additional treatment on functioning. This finding is robust to choice of functional form, length of time over which outcomes are measured, and model specification. Dose does not appear to influence symptomatology.",
    "The high prevalence of DNA aneuploidy in PSC-related CC and the low prevalence in benign PSC strictures point to DNA cytometry as a possible future method for detecting malignant and premalignant changes in bile duct strictures in patients with PSC. This method may be useful in selecting PSC patients for liver transplantation.",
    "Although well accepted by women, light pressure effleurage during genetic amniocentesis does not reduce procedure-related pain or anxiety.",
    "The changes observed were not associated with anaemia during the 15 weeks of MF exposure. However, the decrease in bone marrow cells of the red cell lineage and the changes in iron storage detected at the end of the experiment did not allow the possibility to be ruled out that exposure to 50 Hz MFs may induced delayed biological effects.",
    "The ability of radiologists to detect calcium in a solitary pulmonary nodule by chest radiography was low, as defined by the ROC data. Of the \"definitely calcified\" nodules, up to 7% may not be calcified and may be potentially malignant. Without documentation of long-term stability, a low threshold for recommending CT may be appropriate.",

    "These data suggest that cardioprotection conferred by the Na(+)/H(+) exchange inhibitor cariporide is additive to that of ischemic preconditioning and might effectively contribute to improve donor heart preservation during cardiac transplantation.",
    "There were many significant differences in clinicopathologic characteristics between patients with carcinoma of the cardia and patients with carcinoma of the distal stomach in Japan. The incidence of early cardia carcinoma was very low in Japan, and obesity, smoking, drinking, Barrett esophagus, or GERD were not related to its occurrence, in contrast to reports in the West.",

    "Self-reported age at symptom onset is not associated with memory performance in adult patients with OCD according to tests previously found to be sensitive to frontal-striatal system dysfunction and impairment in OCD. Such dysfunction appears to be a consistent feature of OCD in adults, regardless of age at initial symptom onset.",
    "As hypothesized from experimental data, polyamine levels in blood increase in patients after focal cerebral ischemia. The results indicate that the peripheral spermidine level is closely associated with the clinical outcome as well as with the infarction volume. Therefore, polyamines may be used as a novel predictor for the prognosis of patients with focal cerebral ischemia.",
    "The results indicate that there can be substantial benefit from organized inpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation in the postacute period, which is both statistically significant and clinically important.",
    "Our clinical pathway and algorithm for aortic surgery was easily followed by those patients in the retroperitoneal approach group and resulted in decreases in ICU time, postoperative ileus, volume of intraoperative crystalloid and total length of stay. The patients in the transperitoneal group often failed to progress appropriately on the pathway. Reduced hospital costs associated with aortic surgery using the retroperitoneal approach has increased the profitability for this surgery in our institution by an average of $4000 per case and has increased the value (quality/cost) of this surgery to our patients and our institution.",
    "The current level of involvement in EMS of PEM faculty and fellows has significant room for improvement. It does not appear that grant support translates into increased local involvement in EMS. Current PEM fellowship curriculum guidelines for training in EMS are not being met by the majority of responding training programs.",
    "This finding, which occurred when controlling for walking speed, may be clinically relevant for patients who have both a toe-walking and a stiff-legged gait pattern. Some of the reduced knee flexion in swing may be merely a consequence of toe-walking, rather than a result of other causes, such as intrinsic spasticity or abnormal muscle firing about the knee.",
    "Using KISS data for internal orientation, it is possible to note important differences between ICUs when interpreting infection rates; some initial examples of successful use of surveillance data for the reduction of infection rates are already available. However, the use of such data for external assessment is not possible, because external observers are often unable to fully consider important factors in the interpretation of infection rates.",
    "Heavier women do not benefit from a higher dose of LA depot (7.5 vs. 3.75 mg) for suppression of serum levels of estradiol.",
    "Recent declines in syphilis notifications in the NIS are at least partially a reflection of a reduced intensity of active case finding and of changes in reporting completeness because of a shift in service utilisation from the public to the private/informal sectors. Syphilis rates are still high, indicating that both public and private sectors have to respond more efficiently to the needs of many people at risk of STI. The collection of serial STI prevalence data is recommended to be able to validate trends in notifications.",

    "The report by Fleischmann et al contains serious flaws that limit its validity and generalizability.",
    "Injury researchers have advocated the linkage of major datasets to supplement and improve the quality of injury data. Using capture-recapture we found that routine databases enumerate TRI fatalities accurately, in contrast to injury morbidity databases that do not. Capture-recapture is a potentially useful method of evaluating the completeness of data sources and identifying biases within datasets. However, ascertainment corrected rates should be viewed with caution. A number of requirements of the capture-recapture technique are unachieved in this study of injury in the human population.",
    "Using a multidisciplinary approach, it is possible to reduce antibiotic prescribing for sore throats significantly without adversely affecting outcome.",
    "For the first time in GP stress research, our findings established that higher levels of self-reported occupational stress are predictive of greater ABP in British GPs. More detailed psychophysiological research and stress management interventions are required to isolate the effects of occupational stress in British GPs.",
    "Fifteen-year-olds rarely consult their GP about their emotional well-being, yet, with the GHQ-12, the self-reported rate of psychiatric morbidity was nearly seven times greater than that suggested by these same subjects' medical records. Although the majority of adolescents consult their GP throughout the course of a year, those with mental health problems, including those who attempt suicide, are indistinguishable in the frequency of their GP consultations from adolescents without mental health problems.",
    "Professionals should note the low rate of disclosure among these families. In the absence of conclusive data regarding impact on child functioning, professionals must remain aware of the complexity of disclosure-related decisions when working with HIV-affected families, particularly in terms of the family and cultural milieu within which families operate.",
    "Compression applied to the lumbar intervertebral discs of dogs for up to a year does not produce degeneration in any visible form. It does produce microscopic changes and numerical changes, however, in the amounts of proteoglycan and collagen in the nucleus, inner anulus, and outer anulus. The present results add no credence to the commonly held belief that high compressive forces play a causative role in disc degeneration.",
    "These results suggest that the systematic suppression of fever may not be useful in patients without severe cranial trauma or significant hypoxemia. Letting fever take its natural course does not seem to harm patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome or influence the discomfort level and may save costs.",
    "Even with a standardized implementation protocol, consistent results across institutions were not obtained when a clinical guideline for chest pain was implemented beyond its original setting. These findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the local factors that influence guideline implementation.",
    "Children differed from adults in aetiology, longer presentation interval and fewer associated injuries. Similarities in diagnostic parameters suggest that a single diagnostic approach could be taught for children and adults provided that the limitations of physical examination in small children are recognized.",
    "Based on the findings of the current study, it would appear that the more favorable outcome noted for gastric carcinoma patients in Japan primarily is explained by the differences in tumor location, a greater frequency of early stage disease, and more accurate staging compared with gastric carcinoma patients in the U.S. Results of gastric carcinoma treatment comparable to those obtained in Japan can be obtained in Western centers.",
    "The results of the current study demonstrate that chest X-ray screening might improve the prognosis of patients with lung carcinoma. However, these results are subject to many factors that were only partially controlled and should be interpreted cautiously.",

    "In hepatogastroenterological patients, advancing age was not associated with an overall increased risk of adverse drug reactions except for patients with biliary tract diseases. In the elderly, adverse drug reactions were more severe and carried higher mortality. Guidelines and educational programs should be developed to increase the awareness of adverse drug reactions and their prevention, especially in high risk patients and, thus, to improve patient outcomes.",
    "The results of this relatively small study series suggested that the presence of histologic features of MALToma in patients with primary large cell gastric lymphoma might have been associated with a better response to systemic chemotherapy and a better prognosis. Further studies to consolidate this conclusion are necessary.",
    "Serum AFP levels in HCC patients are not influenced by virus B or C hepatitis pattern. AFP dosage should not be used for HCC diagnosis in non-cirrhotic patients. Male patients with cirrhosis should be regarded with a more \"aggressive\" screening program compared to females.",

    "In our experience, needle aspiration with sonographic guidance is safe and effective in the treatment of pyogenic liver abscesses. Use of catheters is reserved for cases of rapid reaccumulation of exudate without general improvement in the patient.",
    "Severely stressed surgical neonates, compared with controls, generally do not show increased energy expenditures as assessed by isotopic dilution methods. These data suggest that the routine administration of excess calories may not be warranted in critically ill surgical neonates and support the hypothesis that neonates obligately redirect energy, normally used for growth, to fuel the stress response. This is a US government work. There are no restrictions on its use.",

    "Even with local recurrence of prostatic carcinoma after radical prostatectomy, the patients' prognosis 'quo ad vitam' is not bad. The follow-up of patients proves that they profit from implantation of an artificial sphincter in terms of better quality of life.

    "Percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy feeding reduced but did not eliminate gastroesophageal reflux, compared to intragastric feeding in patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux. However, gastroesophageal reflux during percutaneous jejunal feeding was associated with meal infusion. This might, in part, explain the failure of percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy tube placement to prevent pulmonary aspiration.",
    "The presence of lymph node metastases is a critical factor in the prognosis of gastric cancer, and extended lymph node dissection has therefore been recommended. However, extended lymph node dissection in elderly patients did not influence the 5-year survival; in addition, the mortality and morbidity in the extended group were higher than in the limited group. Extended lymph node dissection is therefore usually not indicated for gastric cancer in elderly patients.",

Moreover, the mean ambulatory blood pressure value during the first hour can be considered to be a marker of a higher risk of developing sustained hypertension.",
    "The treatment of primary achalasia by means of combining the application of botulotoxin (Dysport) and balloon dilatation is effective, and it is possible to assume that the clinical remission will last longer than that in result of separate use of just one of the methods. The synchronous treatment of functional blocks in the cervical and thoracic regions of the spine and continuous rehabilitation can participate in the favourable clinical effect. The renewal of primary peristalsis of the oesophagus was achieved in two out of 9 patients. No such change has been either manometrically verified or described in literature.

    "Despite limitations in comparability of patient groups, laparoscopic appendectomy was associated with a significantly lower rate of septic wound complications (p<0.05). This was especially true for the subgroup of obese patients (BMI>26). Therefore, for patients with perityphlitic abscess or fresh purulent lower abdominal peritonitis, but not for patients with generalized peritonitis, laparoscopic appendectomy is not only justifiable but even recommended as the procedure of choice.",

    "If Canadian surgeons and healthcare administrators were to work together to put in place processes to support ambulatory breast cancer surgery and if resources were redirected to the provision of home-based post-operative care, there would be potential for a large net healthcare saving and preservation of high-quality patient care.",
    "cTnI release in patients after OHS with normal coronary arteries has the same profile as cTnI release in patients after CABG in the absence of AMI. However, its peak at 12 hours postoperatively is only correlated to ACC and CPB times, which is contrary to cTnI release after CABG surgery. This observation suggests that cTnI could be a marker of myocardial ischemia after OHS.",
    "The beta-hCG protein is expressed in low-grade prostate cancer and can be detected by RT-PCR in both prostate cancer cell lines and human ejaculate. However, the low percentage of detection in ejaculate suggests that beta-hCG in semen does not provide a useful marker for early prostate cancer detection.",

    "In both treated and control eyes, there was an increase in the prevalence of high myopia between 3 and 12 months of age. Between 12 months and 10 years of age, there was little change in distribution of refractive error in treated or control eyes. The higher prevalence of myopia of 8 D or more in treated eyes, as compared with control eyes, may be the result of cryotherapy's preservation of retinal structure in eyes that, in the absence of cryotherapy, would have progressed to retinal detachment.",

Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting may be the operation of choice for octogenarians requiring surgical myocardial revascularization.",
    "Up to 50% of elderly (>75 years) HD patients can be successfully immunized with a reinforced anti-HBV vaccination schedule, a proportion still much lower than in younger HD patients. The ultimate decision to vaccinate elderly HD patients more or less intensively, or not at all, should depend on the local epidemiology of HBV infection and the individual risk of acquiring HBV (e.g. through holiday dialysis in high prevalence countries). Before vaccinating, serological screening of patients originating from countries with high HBV prevalence is recommended.",

Such information may also help members of the community to make an informed decision regarding participation in such research.",
    "A diagnosis of pulmonary sclerosing haemangioma can be made at intra-operative frozen sections in most cases based on the tumour circumscription and variegated histological patterns. When only a single histological pattern is identified or when there is significant cytological atypia, distinction from other tumours can be problematic, and the diagnosis is best deferred.",

Assessment by the same pathologist reduces the discrepancy but over half the patients are under- or overgraded on final pathology. Clinicians should be aware of these limitations when using the biopsy Gleason grade in decision making.",

These two components represent major causes of frailty and functional decline in older people and could have some common mechanisms. Nevertheless, these results do not predict the causal variable.",
    "Most older adults in this sample did not expect to achieve the model of successful aging in which high cognitive and physical functioning is maintained. Older age was independently associated with lower expectations regarding aging. Furthermore, having low expectations regarding aging was independently associated with not believing it important to seek health care.",

    "This meta-analysis suggests that with stroke rehabilitation, acupuncture has no additional effect on motor recovery but has a small positive effect on disability, which may be due to a true placebo effect and varied study quality. The efficacy of acupuncture without stroke rehabilitation remains uncertain, mainly because of the poor quality of such studies.",
    "Utilizing the regimen employed in the current study, only 3 of 31 patients with osteosarcoma (10%) were cured exclusively with chemotherapy. Four additional patients who underwent extirpation of the primary tumor without disease recurrence and in whom no viable tumor was found in the resected specimens possibly could increase the number of patients who potentially were cured with chemotherapy to 7 (23%). With an overall expected cure rate of 50-65% with \"conventional\" sin whom no viable tumor was found in the resected specimens possibly could increase the number of patients who potentially were cured with chemotherapy to 7 (23%).

This approach will prevent vertical transmission and bring their immune response up to par with term infants. Term intrauterine growth-retarded infants should be vaccinated as per the schedule recommended for normal term infants. However, studies in other settings with different vaccine formulations and a longer follow-up period will be required before this strategy can be practised more widely.",

Thus, in a retrospective study, no evidence has been demonstrated of an association between patient knowledge and the risk of developing colorectal cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis. However, knowledge may have been increased in cases as a direct result of having had colorectal cancer as a complication of ulcerative colitis.",

    "Based on data about critical flow velocities through an radial arterial cannula in neonates, both tested flushing systems carry the risk of exceeding the critical value of 0.5 ml/s. They are likely to cause retrograde embolization of flushing solution into the central arterial circulation with the associated risk of clot and air embolization. In vivo studies should identify margins of safety to minimize the risk of retrograde flushing into the central arterial circulation.",
    "Our results indicate that the incidence of primary gout has increased significantly over the past 20 years. While this increase might be a result of improved ascertainment of atypical gout, it may also be related to other, as yet unidentified, risk factors.",

These lipoparticles belong to the HDL family, which is considered to consist of anti-atherogenic lipoproteins. These results raise the possibility that cardiovascular risk factors are not associated with ARMD. Furthermore, we can hypothesize that ARMD development is linked to perturbations of HDL metabolism.",
    "The prevalence of victimization was not higher in patients with vulvar dysesthesia/vestibulodynia as compared to the control population after controlling for potential confounding variables.",
    "Orthostatic hypotension is very common in the elderly, and diastolic OH is more common than systolic OH. The prevalence of OH is the lowest during the evening, and meals do not increase the prevalence of OH. The intraindividual consistency of OH during the day is poor. Thus, in elderly patients, more attention should be paid to diastolic OH and the diagnosis should be based on repeated measurements.",

    "The study has shown that the apolipoproteins B and A1 provide better information regarding the risk of CAD. Apo B abnormalities exist in large percentages of CAD subjects despite having normal levels of LDLc. Diabetes per se enhances the Apo B concentrations and this could probably be one of the mechanisms of accelerated CAD in diabetes. Hyper Apo B may be an index of CAD risk.",
    "The Joel-Cohen method of opening the abdomen at cesarean delivery is faster then the Pfannenstiel technique at delivering the fetus. However, considering the absence of benefits to the mother and the fetus there is no clear indication for performing a Joel-Cohen incision.",
    "At very low intestinal perfusion pressures (approximately 30 mmHg) dopexamine produces intestinal vasodilation in excess of what is produced by intrinsic autoregulation. This suggests that there is a vasodilatory reserve in the intestine under such conditions and that a pharmacological vasodilator like dopexamine may improve intestinal circulation during regional severe hypotension.",

    "Thigh compression as exerted with class II thigh-length compression stockings is not able to significantly reduce venous diameter or venous reflux. However, with a pressure of 40 to 60 mm Hg on the thigh that can be achieved with strongly applied short-stretch bandages, considerable hemodynamic improvement, including reduced venous reflux, can be obtained in patients with severe stages of chronic venous insufficiency from deep vein incompetence. The practical value of these preliminary findings should be investigated with further clinical trials.",
    "For the outcomes assessed in studies 1 and 2, race appeared to act primarily as a proxy for other variables (eg, injury severity, age, educational achievement), which in turn may be associated with poor outcome after SCI. Theoretical implications and recommendations are discussed.",
    "Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis was detected in 25.7% of children with multiple erythema migrans. Although several clinical and laboratory abnormalities were present significantly more often in patients with elevated cell counts than with normal cerebrospinal fluid findings, discriminatory significance for the majority of these abnormalities was low, particularly because of low negative predictive values. In more than 2/3 of patients with pleocytosis the initial disease was mild, fewer than 1/2 reported systemic symptoms, and meningeal signs were expressed in only 11%.",
    "Patients receiving Thyroidinum had less weight reduction on day 2 after treatment than those receiving placebo. Yet, since no significant differences were found in other outcomes and since adjustment for baseline differences rendered the difference for the main outcome measure non-significant, this result must be interpreted with caution. Post hoc evaluation of the data, however, suggests that by predefining the primary outcome measure in a different way, an augmented reduction of weight on day 1 after treatment with Thyroidinum may be demonstrated. Both results would be compatible with homeopathic doctrine (primary and secondary effect) as well as with findings from animal research.",
    "Lack of normalization of the ALT level at week 12 does not preclude successful virological outcome in hepatitis C patients receiving a combined therapy of IFN and ribavirin. Hepatitis C virus RNA at week 12 may be a useful predictor of treatment outcome in patients without early biochemical response.",

    "Urinary tract colonization or infection may offer protection against sudden intrauterine unexplained death. We hypothesize that the subsequent maternal immune response offers transplacental protection against lethal fetal infections by common pathogens of urinary tract infections. Other health indicators have little impact on sudden intrauterine unexplained death.",

    "Although H. pylori infection has been recognized as a cause of gastric cancer in humans, some large populations with high prevalence of infection have low gastric cancer rates. This so-called \"African enigma\" so far remains unexplained. Our findings suggest that virulence-associated genes of H. pylori may partially explain the African enigma. Other factors, including human genetic polymorphisms and diet, are also suspected to play a major role. Further investigations are needed to test this hypothesis.",
    "Light's criteria are significantly superior to the clinical presumption to separate pleural transudates from exudates. In patients receiving diuretics, Light's criteria lose accuracy, which is similar to that showed by the use of alternative biochemical criteria alone or combined with clinical judgment.",
    "The individual perception of bronchial symptoms is highly variable among perennial allergic rhinitis patients. The lack of a maximal airway-narrowing plateau is related to the presence of sputum eosinophilia, which might be useful in the detection of patients susceptible to anti-inflammatory therapy. Prospective studies evaluating whether these patients are more likely to develop symptomatic asthma in the future and if the early anti-inflammatory treatment prevents its development are needed.",
    "Bronchoscopy in children with suspected PTB has a low yield and does not significantly aid bacteriologic confirmation. External compression at the entrance to the right main bronchus is suggestive of PTB infection.",
    "CPAP therapy was associated with marked short-term and long-term improvements in the vitality of patients with moderate-to-severe OSA in the community. These findings suggest that CPAP therapy is effective in improving the long-term HRQL of patients with OSA.",
    "The findings of moderate to very high between-week reliability of measures of AROM and PPTs in both asymptomatic and chronic neck pain subjects suggest the presence of symptomatology does not adversely affect reliability of these measures. The results support the use of these measures for monitoring change in chronic neck pain conditions.",
    "These data suggest that, as significant numbers of the sample showed marked (Grade 3+) atherosclerosis, concomitant with decreased blood flow in the vertebral arteries, this population is at risk for developing vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Because other Western populations may be similarly at risk, particular care should be taken when considering the use of rotational manipulative therapy techniques in treatments of the cervical spine.",
    "Normal aging does not increase maximum (end-systolic) atrial size. The atrium compensates for changes in LV diastolic properties by augmenting active atrial contraction. Pulmonary vein flow patterns, although diastolic dominant using peak velocity, demonstrated no volumetric change with aging.",
    "Intravenous contrast did not significantly improve the ability of CT to establish a cause of abdominal pain after a negative or nondiagnostic unenhanced CT.",
    "In acute renal failure, delayed nephrology consultation was associated with increased mortality and morbidity, whether or not dialysis was ultimately required. Using observational data, we cannot determine whether these findings reflect residual confounding, selection bias, adverse effects of delayed recognition of acute renal failure, or the benefits of nephrology consultation.",
    "There was no evidence, in humans, of substantial streaming during slow infraophthalmic intracarotid injections. Slow rates of infusion are as good as high rates for infraophthalmic intracarotid drug delivery. This is of special importance for drugs that are not tolerated at high injection rates. Moreover, infraophthalmic intracarotid chemotherapeutic infusion does not require special injectors or catheters.",
    "Flow void artifacts represented severe stenosis in most of the arteries. According to our data, the assumption that flow voids on 3D TOF MRA images represent severe stenosis is justified.",
    "The<ADC>r is associated with functional outcome, but that is because it and DWI lesion volume are also associated with stroke severity. Although DWI lesion features are univariate surrogate outcome predictors, the authors were unable to show that they were independent outcome predictors in the current study. Differences between these and other results may be due to differences in study design, sample size, and case mix.",
    "The four treatment protocols did not show significant between-group difference over the study period. It was interesting to note that isometric exercise training of the quadriceps alone also reduced knee pain towards the end of the treatment period.",
    "We show that quality of family life is related to the severity of AD in children. This confirms the importance of parental assessment of the impact of the disease in the management of AD, because the disease affects the entire family. Also, these results show the response of DFI to change predictably with disease severity. This may imply that the DFI questionnaire could be used as an extra measure of outcome in everyday clinical practice as well as in research studies.",
    "Even with large sample sizes, combining results from a previous randomized trial of B versus C with results from a new randomized trial of A versus B will not guarantee correct inference about A versus C. A three-arm trial of A, B, and C would protect against this problem and should be considered when the sequential trials are performed in the context of changing secular trends in important omitted variables such as therapy in cancer screening trials.",
    "Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is also effective and safe for large lesions. The results of our series confirms that the risk of encountering an incidental adrenal cortical cancer is significantly increased for large lesions, and therefore, in these cases, additional attention is required to observe oncologic surgical principles.",
    "The novel five item criteria (age, weight, inflammation, immobility, and ever use of corticosteroids) are a more accurate tool to identify patients with RA and osteoporosis than the original three item criteria (age, inflammation, and immobility). The clinical decision rules have an acceptable sensitivity and provide a practical tool for the doctor to identify patients with RA who should have a DXA measurement performed.",
    "Depression is commonly presented to GPs who feel that the diagnosis often involves the separation of a normal reaction to environment and true illness. For those patients living in socio-economically deprived environments, the problems, and therefore the depression, are seen to be insoluble. This has an important implication for the construction of educational interventions around improving the recognition and treatment of depression in primary care: some doctors may be reluctant to recognize and respond to such patients in depth because of the much wider structural and social factors that we have suggested in this paper. That it is the doctors working with deprived populations who express these views, means that the 'Inverse care law' [Tudor Hart J. The inverse care Law. Lancet 1971; 1(7696): 405-412] operates in the management of depression.",
    "Linguistic and conceptual problems explain Chinese women's relatively poor access to mental health services. The continuing failure to tackle systematically these communication problems through the routine provision of interpretation and advocacy services lays the health care system open to the charge of \"institutional racism\".",
    "Elective carotid stenting can be performed safely in older patients with several comorbidities. Patient age does not seem to be an independent risk factor for poor outcome after endovascular treatment of internal carotid artery stenosis.",
    "SAECG using X,Y, Z leads mathematically derived from the standard 12-lead ECG compared to true bipolar X,Y, Z leads show a close correlation in filtered QRS duration, but can differ considerably in the other time domain measurements, resulting in different interpretation of LP analysis in 22%. Therefore, SAECG registration should currently be performed with true X,Y, Z leads, until the accuracy of other approaches is validated.",

    "In contrast to adults, nocturnal dipping is preserved in young children with SDB, despite increased sleep fragmentation. As there is evidence that nocturnal dipping is similarly preserved at the school age, childhood may pose a window of opportunity for resolution of SDB when the cardiovascular effects are less marked.",
    "Consequently, interventions are needed to inform nurses on the detrimental influences of surface acting and train them in the daily use of deep acting as the healthier emotional regulation strategy. In addition, interventions targeted at the enhancement of the individual capacity for self-control would be beneficial to nurses' health.",
    "Screening logs at a recruiting trial site may underestimate the trial's target population and overestimate recruitment. Only a subpopulation of all eligible patients may be captured in trial screening logs and subsequently reported on. This may affect the generalisability of the trial's reported findings.",
    "The results show that practising homeopaths may be able to correctly identify a homeopathic medicine from the set of symptoms generated during an HPT. This suggests that such symptom pictures generated by taking an ultramolecular homeopathic medicine are recognisable and specific to the substance taken. Since identification of the remedy was based on past HPT information held in the materia medica, this demonstrates that HPT-generated symptom pictures are reproducible, thus validating the HPT methodology. These promising preliminary findings warrant replication; possible improvements to the trial design to be incorporated in future studies were identified.",

    "Children who appear to have recovered by age 4 from early delay are at modest risk for continuing difficulties, but this appears to be no higher than the risk for other 4-year-olds with equivalent scores, reflecting the continuing variability in longitudinal outcome after age 4. All children in the low normal range at age 4 merit continuing monitoring.",

    "For APBI patients, VMAT improves PTV dose conformity and delivers lower doses to the ipsilateral breast and lung compared to 3D-CRT. This goes at the cost of a slight but acceptable increase of the contralateral breast dose. VMAT reduces cardiac dose if MHD exceeds 0.5 Gy for 3D-CRT. Adding vmDIBH results in a further reduction of heart and ipsilateral lung dose.",

    "Compared with reduction mammoplasty for benign macromastia, a widely accepted procedure, patients undergoing oncoplastic breast reduction were equally likely to have a postoperative complication. Elevated body mass index was shown to be a statistically significant predictor of having a complication after reduction for either indication. Overall complication rates were acceptably low for both procedures.",
    "A significant portion of patients presenting for breast reconstruction have had prior abdominal surgeries. This study demonstrates that these prior procedures represent an acceptable level of risk; although this issue should still be addressed during preoperative patient counseling. In patients with prior hernia repairs, however, additional care should be given to the fascial closure as these patients may be at higher risk for subsequent hernia formation after abdominally based breast reconstruction.",

    "If existent, an AAWS is at least very rare for enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC after taxane-based chemotherapy and does not play a clinical role in this setting. This may be attributed to the different pharmacodynamics of enzalutamide. Longer duration of therapy or a longer withdrawal interval may reveal a rare EWS in the future.",
    "The transcatheter approach for closure of ASDs is an effective and safe treatment option when performed for certain indications.

These two types of patients frequently develop an autoimmune disease (multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, APS). However, a large proportion of the patients had an undefined profile with aspecific cerebral lesions and required monitoring. This study raises questions about a separate entity at the border between APS and multiple sclerosis which remains to be better defined in a larger cohort.",
    "In nulliparous low-risk women a larger infant head circumference at birth increases the likelihood of perineal trauma, although the effect is modest. Antenatal perineal body and genital hiatus measurements do not predict perineal trauma. These results do not support alteration in mode of delivery or other obstetric practices.",
    "These results were consistent with previous reports. We did not show any seasonal pattern of idiopathic ileocolic intussusceptions in our patients. A new survey of childhood intussusceptions would be relevant to confirm these results and would make it possible to modify academic teachings about seasonality in intussusceptions.",
    "Although routine testing is prevalent in ED patients with syncope, the diagnostic yield is relatively low. Nevertheless, some testing, particularly echocardiography, may yield critical findings. Current efforts to reduce the cost of medical care by eliminating nondiagnostic medical testing and increasing emphasis on practicing evidence-based medicine argue for more discriminate testing when evaluating syncope.",

    "Concerns and abilities could be measured using one-unidimensional item bank. Results also support measuring each construct separately. We recommend a conservative approach by measuring and reporting concerns and abilities separately. We therefore recommend two separate but co-calibrated item banks in the PROMIS network: cognitive function item bank-concerns and cognitive function item bank-abilities. Both item banks showed good psychometric properties and are available for research and clinical purposes.",

    "Female gender was found to be predictive factors for the occurrence of nausea. Lung cancer might be closely associated with opioid-induced nausea. The use of steroids might be effective as prophylaxis for nausea. Female gender was also a predictive factor for the occurrence of vomiting. Vomiting occurred even if dopamine D2 blockers (prophylactic medication) were given.",

    "Emotional dysregulation is now known to play a causal role regarding ADHD symptomatology. Along with executive functioning, reaction time variability and potentially delay aversion, emotional dysregulation should therefore be included in future theoretical models of ADHD, as well as in clinical practice when identifying the major impairments in this diagnostic group and when deciding therapeutic strategies.",
    "We advise the use of partial UGSM for CC of 0.5-2 cm, total UGSM for CC of 2.5-3.5 cm, and total USM with use of CC as the anterior vaginal wall in CC ≥ 4 cm in length. Good cosmetic and functional results are obtained with this approach.",

    "Our results demonstrate that multilevel bypass procedures can be performed with good long-term outcomes and acceptable mortality, in what is typically a high-risk group with extensive comorbidities. In patients with severe critical limb ischaemia and tissue loss, who have a combination of aortoiliac and infrainguinal disease, there are significant benefits to a primary multilevel grafting procedure.",
    "Despite of the documented strong inverse relationships between Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and male/female fertility, and also between IR and female infertility via ovarian functions as in polycystic ovary syndrome, to our knowledge, there is no report about any influence of IR on male fertility. DM and metabolic syndrome (MetS) have negative influence on fertility. Thus, IR may be accused of causing detrimental effect on male infertility due to hyperinsulinemic state and being one of the components for MetS. Interestingly, due to our preliminary results, we do not found any inverse correlation between IR and male reproductive functions.",
    "This study, although preliminary, with a low number of participants, shows that sperm quality is not affected by the presence of testicular microlithiasis, because the results of spermiograms are almost comparable between the two groups.",
    "CIMT efficacy did not result to be related to patient's age, mild cognitive deficit, time since stroke. Depression and pinch ability are the main predictors of motor recovery. Despite the demonstrated efficacy, CIMT feasibility still needs to be demonstrated, considering the low percentage (6.5%) of eligibility among all stroke inpatients.",
    "The so-called true C sign (complete or interrupted type A) indicates the presence of a TCC and it is not related to flatfoot deformity. However, it is only present in 41% of the cases. The interrupted C sign is much more likely to be related to flatfoot deformity than to the presence of a TCC, specifically when a type C is found.",
    "Multifocal disease is common in patients with WD/DD retroperitoneal liposarcoma, and tumors can also develop at remote, locoregional sites. Surgical resection remains the primary method of locoregional control in this disease; however, the aggressiveness of resection should be individualized, with consideration of both tumor and patient-related factors.",
    "QOL may not be affected by continence status among young children with SB, though demographic (i.e., age) and condition-specific (i.e., functional mobility status) variables appear relevant. Additional research is needed to further evaluate condition-specific variables, other protective variables, and possible measurement issues that influence QOL in young children with SB.",
    "A newly revised threshold for ALT is proposed as a simple clinical metabolic parameter that can identify a metabolic obese phenotype. We suggest that people with unhealthy normal ALT levels may need further investigation for the presence of metabolic obesity.",
    "The regional palliative care program failed to demonstrate improvement of the pain intensity of cancer outpatients. One possible interpretation is that they are less likely to be regarded as target populations and that the study population experienced generally well-controlled pain. Future study including patients with more severe pain is needed, but to improve pain levels of cancer outpatients, intensive, patient-directed intervention seems to be more promising than region-based intervention.",
    "Female students had higher empathic concern and personal distress dispositions. The differences in the empathy scores of students in different stages of medical school were small. Among all of the studied variables, personal accomplishment held the most important association with decreasing personal distress and was also a predicting variable for perspective taking.",
    "On the basis of the high prevalence found in our study, we suggest that all male patients with DS should be screened for TM in childhood.",
    "We were not able to identify any specific risk factors related to complications, and future multicenter studies will be necessary to determine which patients or wounds are at risk of complications. Propeller flaps had a low failure rate and risk of secondary surgery. These flaps are particularly useful for covering small- and medium-sized defects in the distal leg and Achilles tendon region and are a reliable and effective alternative to free flaps.",

    "In case of ultrasound prenatal suspicion of EA (with or without visualization of the pouch sign), an MRI at 30-32 weeks using fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition should be proposed. Biochemical amniotic fluid may be helpful and should be evaluated in a larger study.",
    "This is the first 5-year report on trauma in Switzerland. Trauma workload was similar to other European countries. Despite high levels of healthcare, mortality exceeds published rates by>50%. Regardless of the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, trauma remains a surgical disease and needs dedicated surgical resources.",
    "Overall, the delayed time to pregnancy observed in women treated with LEEP is likely not due to a LEEP-associated decrease in ovarian reserve as measured by AMH; thus, other mechanism are responsible for the delayed time to pregnancy associated with LEEP.",

    "Coronally advanced flap plus CTG of reduced thickness and height was associated with less patient morbidity, better aesthetic evaluations with no difference in RC outcomes.",
    "Despite poor design and inadequate funding, our findings have shown some promising results after PBF training in the study area. The findings have highlighted the potential of PBF to act as leverage for initiating innovative and proactive actions, which may motivate health personnel performance and quality of care in the study setting with minimal support. However, key policy issues at the national level should be addressed in order to exploit this opportunity.",
    "The present study confirmed the impact of sick quitters on mortality risk, but failed to show that the association between alcohol consumption and mortality is confounded by psychosocial stressors.",
    "Asymmetric metal markings observed on the ball heads tested in this investigation are most probably caused by the presence of contaminants entrapped in the taper fit. Homogenous metal mark distributions around the circumference indicate proper assembly of the ball head without entrapped contaminants. It should, however, be noted that different taper designs may possibly result in different marking patterns.",
    "We believe the results suggest that markets are important sites for WLV knowledge transmission.",
    "A CRP yields improvements over multiple domains of recovery; however, those who start earlier demonstrate greater improvement in functional ambulation independent of baseline factors. These data support the use of adapted CRPs as a standard of care practice after conventional stroke rehabilitation.",
    "Half of the children with RLAI had tracheo and/or bronchomalacia, their frequency being in keeping with previous reports and far higher than that observed in controls. It was associated with profuse respiratory secretions and with a higher frequency of positive BAL cultures mostly for non typable H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae which were not isolated in controls.",
    "The results of this study question the classical mechanisms of formation of the paranasal sinuses. According to the hypothesis of postnatal bone cavitation resulting from bone marrow involution and centripetal gas production, paranasal sinuses would constitute distinct organs that develop independently of the ethmoidal olfactory organ, which is formed from the embryonic cartilaginous olfactory capsule.",
    "Endogenous MSSA colonization does not appear to protect against nosocomial MRSA acquisition in a population of medical patients without frequent antibiotic exposure.",
    "Obese patients are at higher risk for postoperative hypoxia, but this leads to a prolonged intensive care unit stay only for moderate-morbid obese patients. Obese patients are partially protected against the deleterious effects of hemodilution and transfusions. Underweight patients present the \"paradox\" of a better lung gas exchange but a longer intensive care unit stay. This is probably due to a higher severity of their cardiac disease.",
    "We found a negative correlation between TNRmax and nADCmin for each glioma; however, MET uptake and ADC within a tumor were independent of each other and were heterogeneous. The two parameters represent different biological features; thus, as a comprehensive approach, MET PET and DW MRI might have a complementary role in the characterization of gliomas.",
    "After 2 years, there were no disparities in health-related QOL, physician-reported Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events GI toxicity, or biochemical relapse. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm these findings.",
    "This study reveals that LCBDE is safe in the elderly patients and results are not different from those described in the general population. Patients with choledocholithiasis should be offered to undergo an LCBDE irrespective of their age at diagnosis.",
    "Stronger adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with lower all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality, largely independently of cultural background. These associations were primary due to the effect in men. Our finding of a beneficial rather than a deleterious impact of dairy products consumption prompts at considering culturally adapted Mediterranean diet recommendations. However, results should be interpreted with caution since only a crude 1-day dietary estimate was available to assess individuals' habitual dietary intake.",
    "In the majority of the patient-proxy couples there was agreement. Proxies can serve as a valuable source of information, but caution remains essential when using scores from proxies.",
    "The complete normal biliary system (extrahepatic bile duct confluence included) is not consistently visualized in infants younger than 3 months old on non-enhanced MRCP. Thus the use of MRCP to exclude a diagnosis of biliary atresia is compromised at optimal time of surgery.",
    "The navigation procedure could not be performed for technical reasons in 4% of the series. The mean registration error was 0.65 mm in this series and the navigation procedure itself adds a mean of 35 minutes during surgery. The complications rate for this series was 14%. We found a nonunion rate of 6% in allograft reconstructions when we used a navigation system for the cuts.",

    "Altered HRV and RRV (during the SBT prior to extubation) are significantly associated with extubation failure. A predictive model using RRV during the last SBT provided optimal accuracy of prediction in all patients, with improved accuracy when combined with clinical impression or RSBI. This model requires a validation cohort to evaluate accuracy and generalizability.",
    "Patients on ART for a relatively longer duration reported poorer HRQoL at the study facility independent of the effect of other therapy-related, clinical, and sociodemographic factors. Program managers and clinicians in the Kenyan health system may need to refocus attention on this subgroup to avert 'loss to treatment' that may have negative repercussions on the substantial gains made against the HIV scourge.",
    "L-type Ca2+ channel are present in esophagus and in other GI muscles, their affinity is similar, but their density is relatively sparse.

    "Women seem to be functionally more impaired by stroke than men.",
    "In an alcoholic smoking population, the prevalence of esophageal cancer detected by endoscopy is high and not related to symptoms described by patients. Lugol staining only moderately improves the diagnostic accuracy of videoendoscopy; its main advantage is the assessment of the mucosal extension of esophageal cancer.",

    "The increased plasma YKL-40 in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis may reflect the remodelling of liver fibrosis.",
    "The correlation between leptin and adiposity found in children and adults was also found in newborns. Serum leptin concentrations in newborns were increased more than three-fold compared with children in Tanner stages 1 and 2 when controlling for adiposity, suggesting that leptin concentrations in the newborn are not explained by adiposity alone. Maternal leptin concentrations correlated with measures of adiposity at delivery but did not correlate with newborn adiposity or leptin. Leptin mRNA was expressed both in placental tissue and in two human placental cell lines. These data suggest that leptin has a role in intrauterine and neonatal development and that the placenta provides a source of leptin for the growing fetus.",
    "There is no evidence that putting infants to sleep in the supine position results in increased morbidity, although changes in prevalence of rare disorders would not have been identified.",
    "The risks of extended cardiac evaluation and treatment did not produce any improvement in either the perioperative or the long-term survival rate. For most vascular surgery patients who have a positive result of a DT scan, coronary angiography does not provide any additional useful information.",
    "Patients with diabetes who undergo carotid endarterectomy are more likely to have coexisting cardiac disease, which may contribute to a higher incidence of postoperative cardiac morbidity. Diabetes mellitus alone, however, is not a risk factor for postoperative cardiac morbidity in patients who undergo carotid surgery. In addition, carotid endarterectomy may be safely performed in patients with diabetes with neurologic morbidity and mortality rates that are comparable with those of the nondiabetic population",
    "Simply giving a random group of GPs computer assistance to choose less expensive drugs did not reduce expenditure per DDD. Cost containment procedures should be more intensive than just giving the doctors a computer-assisted decision aid.",
    "Continuous administration of heparin with an average dose of approximately 500 U/h did not negatively influence platelet function in the trauma patients. Recovery from reduced platelet function in the sepsis group was not affected by continuous heparinization. Thus, continuous heparinization with this dose appears to be safe with regard to platelet function in the intensive care patient.",
    "The current literature does not provide adequate data on critical care unit admission practices to allow useful application of the method of benchmarking. There is a need for publicly accessible large databases to allow individual critical care units to determine their level of efficiency when compared to similar institutions.",

    "The generalized estimating equation models enabled simultaneous examination of whether children of depressed mothers have excess behavior problems and whether depressed mothers overreport behavior problems in their children. The results indicate that children of depressed mothers have more internalizing problems. In addition, depressed mothers overstate and overgeneralize their offspring's behavior problems. This study broadens the concerns with reporting bias beyond maternal depression to include other psychiatric problems. The results emphasize the potential for bias in family history studies that rely on informants.",
    "We conclude that mitral valve repair is preferable to mitral valve replacement when possible, in patients with complications of endocarditis, as repair results in a lower hospital mortality and an improved long-term survival.",
    "The concomitant finding of these two organisms in the patient's amniotic fluid and a history of periodontal disease in her partner suggests that chorioamnionitis may have been due to an ascending infection after orogenital contact.",
    "We found that, depending on the age of the patient, prophylactic oophorectomy results in a 4% to 10.9% reduction in the incidence of ovarian carcinoma. This increases to 16.6% to 26.9% if one considers general surgery procedures in which access could be more difficult. Although we are not advocating the frequent use of this procedure, we recommend that surgeons routinely discuss this option before surgery with their postmenopausal female patients over 49 years of age. Given that the decision for prophylactic oophorectomy is multifaceted, we feel that a risk scoring for ovarian cancer and a discussion of the risk and benefit ratio should be undertaken. The ultimate goal is to heighten patient awareness of the risk factors to ensure that an informed decision is made concerning this consistently lethal disease.",
    "In the absence of explicit criteria, we found modest but statistically significant agreement among radiologists about the appropriateness of individual requests for imaging procedures. The disagreement among radiologists highlights the importance of developing well-reasoned, explicit criteria by which to judge the appropriateness of diagnostic radiology procedures. Further study is needed to elucidate the relationship between appropriateness and actual patient outcomes.",

    "Almost all minor VSDs are recognized without echocardiography; however, errors can occur even when an expert examiner is confident. Clinical recognition of an intermediate or major VSD is less accurate than clinical recognition of a minor VSD. Failure to distinguish VSDs of major or intermediate importance from minor VSDs is a weakness of the expert clinical examination.",
    "The reduction in prenatal visits achieved using the experimental schedule was not accompanied by an increase in the use of other medical services compared with the routine schedule. The use of the schedule proposed by the Expert Panel on the Content of Prenatal Care improved the efficiency of delivery of prenatal care to low-risk women.",
    "Granulomatous inflammatory disease isolated to the appendix differs from typical Crohn's disease with a decreased occurrence of enterocutaneous fistulas and rare recurrence. Consequently, isolated granulomatous appendicitis without small bowel or cecal involvement may not represent true Crohn's disease. Patients can be treated with minimal morbidity by appendectomy alone. If isolated granulomatous appendicitis does represent Crohn's disease, its longterm course in the majority of patients is extremely benign.",
    "In the linear forearm position from the radial artery to an antecubital vein, there is no difference in the performance of 6-mm standard e-PTFE grafts on the basis of manufacturer, whether Goretex or Impra. On the basis of performance, linear forearm dialysis grafts are an acceptable method for hemodialysis access.",
    "This survey shows that survival after unwitnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is unlikely with an initial response of basic life support alone. Withdrawal of resuscitation should be considered if an adult victim of unwitnessed cardiac arrest is found in asystole and the arrest is of obvious cardiac origin.",
    "The results of the current study show that CD44v6 is localized differently in fetal and adult lung, suggesting a difference in function. In the fetal lung, it may modulate growth factors important in morphogenesis and maturation. In the adult nonneoplastic lung, CD44v6 is associated with stem cells, namely basal cells and type 2 pneumocytes, and may act to anchor these cells to the matrix and be important in migration during repair or neoplasia. In addition, CD44v6 expression is maintained throughout tumorigenesis in squamous cell carcinoma and bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, suggesting a histogenetic relationship between the stem cells and the respective tumors. Conversely, most neuroendocrine tumors and the cells of the dispersive neuroendocrine system do not express CD44v6, implying a separate histogenetic lineage in these tumors.",
    "Evidence from this study suggests that the ASI has a number of limitations in assessing the problems of clients with severe and persistent mental illness, and it is likely that other similar instruments based on the self-reports of persons with severe and persistent mental illness would also encounter these limitations.",
    "The increase in vascular resistance in the hypertensive patients is due primarily to changes in the large and small vessels of the arterial bed. We found no evidence for a generally increased arteriolar constriction.",
    "These data support findings from other institutions suggesting a role for CLI as potentially curative therapy with acceptable toxicity and a short treatment time for patients with Stages I and II and limited Stage III disease.",
    "Our data reveal that 9 of 14 (64%) patients with close margins, LVI, or PNI were DOD or AWD, and 6 of 9 of those patients suffered local regional failure alone. Brachytherapy has the potential to cure 6 of 14 (43%) patients with these risk factors. Further study of brachytherapy at the time of pelvic extenteration is warranted.",
    "The results give rise to the supposition that the energy consumption for the lifting technique with the bent back is lower and is therefore preferred in everyday life and during exercise. These findings should be taken into consideration when informing people about possible damages.",
    "The laparoscopic surgical approach is safe and effective and by no means more expensive than the open approach. In the future, the laparoscopic approach can only become more cost efficient; techniques will improve and there will be earlier returns to work and, subsequently, greater productivity.",

    "The behavior of Ewing's sarcoma and PNET in adults is no different from its behavior in children. We feel the way forward in the treatment of adults with Ewing's sarcoma and PNET is for them to be included in the current multicenter trials of multidisciplinary treatment directed at children.",
    "This study demonstrates that with effective multiagent chemotherapy, histologic subtype does not influence outcome. The high relapse rates in stage I MC subtype indicates that MC HD is biologically aggressive and systemic treatment with or without local irradiation may be indicated. The high relapse rate in stage IV patients appeared to be independent of histology.",
    "Sex did not significantly influence the results of the in-service examination or the written board examination. Institution of training is the strongest influence on the results of the in-service examination.",
    "Reversible cognitive dysfunction is a quiet and unobtrusive disorder.",
    "Preterm twins can breast feed as successfully as preterm singleton infants; as with sufficient assistance and encouragement, their rates of breast feeding were comparable to those of term infants. Although the resources of this hospital do not allow preterm infants to become fully breast fed before discharge, the current programme at National Womens Hospital is effective in establishing successful breast feeding in these high risk infants.",
    "The results in Arm B demonstrated the opportunity of a long term control in this subset of patients. Therefore we suggest the start of a wider multicenter study in order to define the biological significance of SLM, its importance in staging breast cancer and to consider the optimum treatment.",
    "Isolated pelvic abscesses after abdominal surgery and isolated abdominal abscesses after pelvic surgery appear to be very uncommon in oncologic patients. CT initially need be directed only to the region of surgery in this particular patient population.",
    "Patients with CFS show alterations in measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system function. These results, which provide the physiological basis for the orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms of autonomic function in this patient group, may be explained by cardiovascular deconditioning, a postviral idiopathic autonomic neuropathy, or both.",
    "The results from this study, using a large sample drawn from a community, support the view that the CHBPD is not related to anxiety, depression and other forms of psychological distress, but rather is a reaction specific to the clinic setting itself.",
    "These results demonstrate that an ET-1-NO interaction exists in control cerebral arteries in such a way that endothelial and nonendothelial NO partially counteract the contractile response to ET-1 and that although SAH did not modify the effect of nonendothelial NO, the absence of endothelial NO after SAH may contribute to the hyperreactivity of cerebral arteries to ET-1 and, thereby, to the development of cerebral vasospasm.",
    "Previous anatomic and electron microscopy studies demonstrated, in human spinal meninges, the presence of an intermediate layer attached to the inner aspect of the arachnoid, extending laterally over the dorsal surface of the spinal cord and arborizing over the nerve roots and blood vessels. The intermediate layer is not present in human cerebral leptomeninges. The presence/absence of this layer might explain the hypointense rim detected by MRI and might also explain why no penetration and no peritumoral edema is observed in spinal meningiomas as compared with intracranial meningiomas.",
    "The decrease in the dielectric constant of the solvent induces in beta-lactoglobulin an equilibrium intermediate state. This state, being denatured, is relatively compact and has pronounced secondary structure and high affinity for the hydrophobic fluorescent probe 8-ANS, i.e. possesses all the properties of the molten globule intermediate state.",
    "Although a cesarean decision-incision time<or = 30 minutes is a desirable goal for the fetus possibly in distress, failure to achieve this goal is not associated with a measurable negative impact on newborn outcome.",
    "Despite recommendations from the Royal College of General Practitioners, around half the respondents in this survey do not have direct access to ultrasound for obstetric referrals, and a quarter for non-obstetric referrals. Interest shown by GPs in a primary care-led service is not mirrored by their radiology colleagues. Open access to ultrasound was considered the optimum service, suggesting that resources be targeted at improving hospital services rather than transferring facilities to primary care.",

    "The renal-protective effect of low-dose dopamine in the setting of CHF and vigorous diuresis is supported by this study.",
    "Topical application of nitroglycerine represents a new, easily handled, and effective alternative in the treatment of anal fissures. All of our patients reported a dramatic reduction in acute anal pain. However, it should be noted that a lack of sphincter tone reduction is a likely reason for the great tendency of chronic anal fissures to recur.",
    "High t-PSA levels are very good indicators for the presence of PC. There is still concern for improving the differentiation between BPH and PC, when an intermediate or low value (<or = 95% specificity) is observed. The determination of Q is only useful in this range and is helpful for the clinician's decision whether to apply or avoid biopsy.",
    "Clinicians disagree on the value of routine rectal biopsy in the investigation of diarrhea. In patients presenting with diarrhea, the diagnostic yield from biopsy of normal looking rectal mucosa is low. Life threatening complications can occur and in unselected patients routine biopsy should not be performed.",
    "Overall, plastic 'pseudobran' was as effective at altering colonic function as wheat bran at a similar dosage but with fewer particles. The mechanism is not by increased faecal water. Reduction in enzyme activity with plastic flakes suggests that the plastic led to qualitative and, probably, beneficial changes in the bacterial flora or their metabolic processes. The concept of roughage deserves to be revived.",
    "Insulin and glucose levels were both risk factors for hypertension, and this risk was enhanced in the case of a positive FHH. However, obesity, especially central obesity, confounded these relationships and might be an intermediary factor in the relationship between insulin and hypertension.",

    "Significant histologic liver disease is common in cystic fibrosis, although the exact nature of the lesion cannot be predicted without liver biopsy. A clinical liver score that was developed for this may be useful in determining which patients require more definitive evaluation.",
    "The effect of combination treatment with NaF and etidronate on the BMD of the lumbar spine in corticosteroid treated patients with established osteoporosis is superior to that of etidronate alone.",
    "MES are an infrequent finding in patients with TIA or ischemic stroke within 72 hours of onset, but they can be recorded more easily with serial registration. In our patients, MES were found only on the symptomatic middle cerebral artery and were present in atherothrombotic and cardioembolic episodes but not in small-vessel disease.",
    "MES are not detectable in patients with chronic MCA stenoses of different degrees. No MES were found in either symptomatic or asymptomatic stenoses, regardless of the patients' medication. These results indicate that chronic MCA stenoses do not represent a significant embolic source. The absence of MES in the prestenotic Doppler sample volume, the watershed-type infarcts during follow-up, and the absence of small-vessel disease on computed tomography suggests that hemodynamic mechanisms are responsible for recurrent cerebral ischemia.",
    "(1) There is no increased risk for preterm delivery in intensively-treated gestational diabetes mellitus patients; (2) In a population such as this women with gestational diabetes mellitus who deliver preterm cannot be characterised by their glycaemic profile.",
    "The gender difference in the age at onset of schizophrenia is not a robust biological characteristic of the disorder. Failure to control for marital status and premorbid personality in male/ female comparisons of age at onset may explain a large part of the differences reported previously.",
    "The significant rise in asthma and related respiratory conditions coupled with reduced PFT observed in this study suggest that the increase over time in the prevalence of asthma is a true increase in morbidity and not due to reporting bias. The increased prevalence of asthma could be observed in all the communities studied and does not seem to be connected with the operation of the power plant.",
    "Physician gender is a predictor of whether an outpatient medical visit generates an imaging study. Reasons for this observation are unclear, but may be the result of different practice styles of male and female physicians or unmeasured patient characteristics.",
    "An overall decrease in the incidence rate over the last decade was observed, most marked in the pauciarticular- and systemic-onset subtypes. This decrease, along with the observed cyclical pattern, suggest that environmental factors may influence disease frequency.",
    "We conclude that conversion of LC to OC is more prevalent among males and is probably attributable to a greater incidence of anatomical difficulties.",
    "Graduates of the UBC rural training program consider themselves better prepared for rural family practice than non-program-trained rural physicians in several areas of family practice. Most graduates of the program were practising in rural and regional settings.",
    "It is suggested, that HRV and SA in dogs depend on conscious state and anaesthesia. On the basis of our results we can anticipate that the most important for HRV is the present status of the sympathetic nerve. We suggest, that our results are an important finding for experimental arrhythmology. (Fig. 4, Ref. 24.)",
    "Mortality reduction from selective decontamination of the digestive tract appears related to the mortality risk of patients at the time of study entry. Future trials should consider using baseline risk assessment as part of trial design and outcome analysis.",
    "In ibuprofen-pretreated patients, significantly higher endotoxin concentrations as well as bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes occurred, despite the absence of a transient decrease in mean arterial pressure that had been associated with PGI2 release. Therefore, we hypothesized that during major abdominal surgery, endogenous PGI2 released in response to mesenteric traction may play a crucial role in maintaining splanchnic microcirculation and thus preserving gut mucosal barrier function.",
    "Oesophageal peristaltic dysfunction and reflux are frequent in alcoholism. High amplitude contractions in the middle third of the oesophagus seem to be a marker of excessive alcohol consumption, and tend to improve with abstinence.",
    "Diabetics with dementia rarely have AD except as a component of mixed dementia. Apo-E genotyping showed only average E4 allele frequency in diabetics compared with the high E4 frequency found in AD patients. However, mixed dementia in diabetics may be associated with the E4 allele, suggesting that close control of diabetes may be particularly important for those with E4 since they may be more likely than others to develop both diseases.",
    "Transfusion of blood products was required in a small percentage of our patients even without autologous blood donation. Therefore, the overall cost of care is decreased but, more importantly, the potential risks associated with autologous or allogeneic blood transfusion are eliminated.",
    "In 71 consecutive patients undergoing radical prostatectomy no tumor was found in the distal 1 cm. of the seminal vesicles, including 12 with seminal vesicle invasion. We continue to advocate complete excision of the seminal vesicles during radical prostatectomy. However, if dissection is difficult and a small fragment is left behind, the prognosis is unlikely to be altered.",
    "When incontinent urinary diversion is necessary in children, a colonic conduit with the option of continent conversion should be created before deterioration of the upper urinary tract.",
    "Sufficient pouch capacity is achieved with our proposed operative technique. Urine pH must be monitored to prevent possible ulcerations and perforations.",
    "Although they may be useful for some surgical diagnoses, DRG-specific hospital mortality rates probably cannot accurately detect poor-quality outliers for medical diagnoses. Even collapsing to all medical DRGs, hospital mortality rates seem unlikely to be accurate predictors of poor quality, and punitive measures based on high mortality rates frequently would penalize good or average hospitals.",
    "Bone scintigraphy can be used in radiograph-negative scaphoid area injury to exclude the need for further follow-up reliably, but those with positive scans still require clinical examination and radiography at 2 weeks.",
    "Revascularization surgery cannot always prevent rebleeding. However, a decrease in moyamoya vessels was induced by surgery, which may reduce the risk of hemorrhage more effectively than conservative treatment. In cases of adult moyamoya disease, direct bypass is particularly important, since the indirect revascularization is not as useful in adult cases as in pediatric cases.",
    "These results suggest that most male mycosis is sexually acquired and constitutes a self-reported indicator as good as other sexually transmitted diseases for high risk. Female mycosis may help define an intermediate HIV risk group.",
    "It was demonstrated that enhanced education and individualized feedback can change anesthesiologists' practice patterns. The actual benefit to patients from use of preventive measures was limited when used in the everyday clinical situation. Therefore, only modest decreases in PONV were achieved, despite the use of preventive measures.",
    "This study found no significant increase in penetrating trauma or violent crime predisposing to penetrating injury in south-western Sydney.",
    "Although there was no gross evidence of small bowel intestinalization by the interposed segments, there was evidence of adaptation which was not merely an extension of the adaptive process seen after SBR alone. These changes resulted in the colon taking on some small bowel features. There was no significant difference between proximal vs distal interposed segments.",
    "Conventional radiographs do not contribute to the identification of good or poor responders.",
    "These findings confirm that routine surveillance heart biopsies beyond 6 months after transplantation are not necessary and they should be performed only if there is clinical suspicion of rejection or as part of a research protocol.",
    "The present results support the hypothesis that cyclosporin, at immunosuppressant and nontoxic doses, can delay the onset and progression of accelerated atherosclerosis and that its effects are more significant at the recipient side of the anastomosis where accelerated atherosclerosis begins to develop.",
    "The finding that the S-Delta interval could become shorter than the A2HB-Delta interval provides strong evidence that this accessory pathway was not connected to the AV node but arose directly from the atrial tissue of the posteroseptal region.",
    "Stopping maintenance treatment with inhaled corticosteroids may not be advisable in all patients with mild asthma. Instead of stopping or interrupting treatment, family physicians are advised to determine the minimal effective daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids for each individual patient that provides adequate control of the disease.",
    "Participants were not accurate in measuring small insulin doses, consistently overdrawing insulin by an average of 0.22 U. Caretakers are reasonably internally consistent with a given dose, since participants were able to measure statistically significant differences in 0.25 U dose changes. The error in insulin measurement does not vary with the intended dose level. Caretakers in the same family deliver insulin doses as variable from each other as they are from the population as a whole; however, when two or more individuals are responsible for one insulin dose in a child with IDDM, they have a combined variability that is approximately 40% greater than a single individual's variability.",
    "We conclude that IS, using the antibody applied in this study, is of only limited value in patients with ocular melanoma. Our results suggest that antigenic differences, rather than histological characteristics or technical problems, are responsible for the low sensitivity in ocular melanoma compared to cutaneous melanoma.",
    "In the context of quality management measures, a careful evaluation of on-scene diagnoses, therapeutic measures, and decisions made by the emergency physician is a suitable procedure for identifying systematic errors. A high percentage of correct diagnoses and therapy at the emergency site can only be ensured by clinically experienced physicians who constantly deal with patients with acutely life-threatening conditions.",
    "Beyond the analgesia provided by the regional anesthesia of the ilioinguinal and field blocks, the preoperative use of ketorolac further reduced postoperative pain scores and the need for additional postoperative analgesic medication. Comparable outcomes for the i.v., i.m. and i.w. groups indicate the lack of any benefit to concentrating the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug at the wound (i.w.) or to achieving high blood levels rapidly (i.v.). In conclusion, ketorolac is a useful supplement to ilioinguinal plus field block regional anesthesia for hernia surgery and is most effective administered parenterally.",
    "In normal women there is a continuum of risk related to the maternal glucose level 2 h after a glucose tolerance test for the probability of having an assisted delivery and the likelihood of the baby being admitted to an SCN. The chance of having pregnancy-induced hypertension or a LGA baby also increased as the maternal glucose level increased but could be largely explained by an increasing body mass index.",
    "Our findings seem to suggest that HCV is irrelevant as a risk factor for a fatty liver. The results indicated that there is a 'confounding' role of obesity and hyperlipidaemia, and that the severity of liver disease is associated with steatosis and HCV.",
    "Despite the potential for curative resection in patients with ampullary carcinoma, the majority of such patients are unsuitable for curative surgery on grounds of age, general health status or advanced disease; since only 37% of patients undergo potentially curative surgery the condition has a poor prognosis.",
    "In vivo balloon size may not be accurately predicted from manufacturers' published data. Size is more likely to be affected by factors such as lesion characteristics and elasticity of the vessel wall than by balloon material compliance characteristics.",
    "The results of this study suggest that patients with isolated office hypertension should not be considered as truly normotensive individuals. Hence, these patients require a careful medical follow-up. Office blood pressure readings alone, however, do not appear to provide a good indicator of the long-term outcome of isolated office hypertension.",
    "The relationships between decreased insulin sensitivity and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia and blood pressure were rather weak. It is possible that different mechanisms may control blood pressure in lean and obese subjects, with a weaker association between insulin level and blood pressure in obese subjects. Alternatively, in obese subjects long-standing hyperinsulinaemia might increase blood pressure by mechanisms such as sympathetic activation and effects of vasculature, which may mask the underlying contribution of hyperinsulinaemia.",
    "The results from this in-vitro study indicate that the presence of pravastatin in bile may not influence gallbladder bile lithogenicity. It can be hypothesized that this also applies to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.",
    "Disregarding a lack of difference in the incidence of abnormal sphincter of Oddi baseline pressure between type II and type III SOD, the Geenen-Hogan classification helps to predict the clinical outcome after endoscopic sphincterotomy.",

    "The use of pedicle screw fixation on the convex portion of the lumbar spine in patients with double major idiopathic scoliosis allows for improved correction of the lumbar Cobb measurement, horizontalization and translation of the lowest instrumented vertebra, and improved segmental lordization over the instrumented levels without increased complications.",
    "The PI/PImax ratio cannot be used to predict extubation outcome in pediatric patients. Indices that predict extubation outcome in adults should not be extrapolated to infants and children before testing and validation.",
    "It was found that children who had adequated psychologic preparation prior to the correction of congenital heart defects had better psychological results with the imposed trauma.",
    "These findings show that in HIV-infected patients with a CD4 count under 100/mm3, the presence of acid-fact bacilli can indicate either M. tuberculosis or M. avium intracellulare. Combined anti-tuberculosis and antimycobacteriosis therapy thus would appear to be justified until the germ can be identified.",
    "The respective symptoms at entry in childhood were also predictors of their occurrence in young adults. The results show that the common respiratory symptoms such as persistent phlegm and wheeze with colds in childhood are related to those in young adults rather than is an allergy skin test to an extract of house dust in childhood.",
    "A role of immunological mechanisms in HCV associated thrombocytopenia appears to be ruled out. The authors conclude that tests for HCV infection should be included in the evaluation of thrombocytopenia in adults and a possible direct involvement of HCV cannot be excluded.",
    "There is no evidence to suggest that SSRIs are more cost-effective than TCAs. The debate will only be concluded when a prospective cost-effectiveness study is done in the setting of a large primary care based RCT.",
    "Amenorrhoea did not discriminate between women with anorexia nervosa and women with all the features except amenorrhoea across a number of relevant variables. The authors question the utility of amenorrhoea as a diagnostic criterion.",
    "Use of ICPs to screen patients involved in staff blood exposures during regular hours may be the most efficient method of follow-up, particularly if supplemented by a backup team of health professionals on nights and weekends. Although screening all patients for HBV/HIV may detect patients with undisclosed high-risk behaviors, institutions must decide whether the practice is cost-effective in areas of low prevalence.",
    "General practitioners appeared to operate enthusiast bias' and issued more self-management plans to patients with uncontrolled asthma. The reduction in morbidity in this group is probably a result of the use of the plans, but the verdict on whether plans reduce morbidity must be deemed 'not proven'.",
    "We conclude that the use of such techniques could provide support to partnerships going through significant periods of change.",
    "We conclude that even at the extreme end of a continuum such as represented by well-conditioned, middle-aged marathon runners, cardiovascular risk factors are related to the degree of fitness, as measured by the marathon running time.",
    "Psychiatrists exposed to strict conflict of interest policies prescribed heavily promoted antipsychotics at rates similar to academic psychiatrists and nonacademic psychiatrists exposed to less strict or no policies.",

    "Having received religious education and prayer use were related to the presence of fewer MBRFs in European adults aged 50+ years. These lifestyle factors should be assessed as potential determinants of MBRFs adoption when examining chronic disease development in multicultural populations.",
    "Cerebral autoregulation showed to be disturbed in 35% of post-CA patients of which a majority had pre-CA hypertension. Disturbed cerebral autoregulation within the first 24h after CA is associated with a worse outcome. In contrast to uniform MAP goals, the time spent under a patient tailored optimal MAP, based on an index of autoregulation, was negatively associated with survival.",
    "Suicidal hanging is a relatively rare cause of death for potential organ donors. Because it does not appear to negatively affect outcomes after LTx, it should not be considered per se a contraindication for lung donation. A word of caution is necessary until we gather larger experience with lungs from hanging donors.",

    "The rate of failed intubations in patients undergoing cesarean delivery may be equivalent to non-obstetric patients. In time-challenging cesarean deliveries, delay of conversion from non-successful neuroaxial anesthesia to general anesthesia in order to avoid adverse airway events does not appear to be justified.",

    "Our results show that the presence of a non-cleaved embryo on day 3 is associated with a more exuberant response to controlled ovarian stimulation as reflected by more oocytes retrieved. Despite the significant decrease in quality of the whole cohort in the non-cleaved group, implantation, delivery rates and number of embryos frozen were not adversely affected by the presence of a non-cleaved embryo.",

    "Patients from lower-income quartiles had decreased reperfusion on the first admission day, compared with patients from higher-income quartiles. The cost of hospitalization of patients from higher-income quartiles was significantly higher than that of patients from lowest-income quartiles, despite longer hospital stays in the latter group. This might be partially attributable to a lower use of key procedures among patients from lowest-income quartile.",
    "Time pressure from work might create barriers for people to receive particular preventive health services, such as breast cancer screening, cervical cancer screening and dental check-ups. Health practitioners should be aware of this particular source of barriers to care.",

Inflammatory markers exhibited no statistically significant difference. We think that the atherosclerotic process stems not only from the inflammatory effects of RA, but also perhaps from its immunological nature.",
    "Tetraplegic athletes and sedentary individuals have a high incidence of supraspinatus tendinosis, bursitis and ACJ degeneration. Statistical analysis showed that there is a possible protective effect of sport in the development of shoulder injuries. Weak evidence was encountered for infraspinatus and subscapularis tendinopathy and muscle atrophy (P=0.09, P=0.08 and P=0.08, respectively). Strong evidence with P=0.04 suggests that sedentary tetraplegic individuals are at a greater risk for ACJ and labrum injuries.",

    "In our population, obesity increases Perioperative Myocardial Infarction and septicaemia after cardiac surgery, but does not influence in-hospital mortality. Although we found better 1-year survival in overweight patients, our results do not support any protective effect of obesity in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",
    "The literature has broadly addressed the association between caregiving burden and satisfaction and the caregivers' well-being, whereas this association with regard to care recipients' well-being has been barely examined. The multivariate analyses showed that caregiving burden was insignificant in explaining loneliness, whereas greater caregiving satisfaction was found significant in explaining lower levels of loneliness. The results and implications for further research and practice are discussed.",

    "In this study, the decrease in blood reperfusion at 1h measured by B-flow USG was apparently higher than that measured by Doppler USG. However, by the end of 2h, the measurements were equal (see Fig. 3 and 4). In conclusion, B-flow USG reveals the decrease in the blood flow more distinctly in the early phase. Moreover, B-flow Doppler USG is more reliable and advantageous than color Doppler USG because it provides a more accurate preoperative evaluation of the unilateral and contralateral preoperative adnexial structures, and allows for a better assessment of blood flow in the ovarian torsion.",
    "Preoperative screening UGI before routine G-tube placement led to an unexpected diagnosis of malrotation in only 1.7%. Given the added radiation risk associated with an UGI, our data suggest that an UGI is unnecessary prior to routine G-tube placement. A larger prospective study is warranted to validate these results.",
    "Despite being recommended in national clinical guidelines, the UK-WHO and customised birth weight charts perform poorly at identifying infants at risk of adverse neonatal outcomes. Being small or large may increase the risk of an adverse outcome; however, size alone is not sensitive or specific enough with current detection to be useful. However, a significant amount of missing data for some of the outcomes may have limited the power needed to determine true associations.",
    "This 2-year longitudinal study in very old institutionalized individuals shows that arterial stiffness and high HR enabled us to identify subjects at higher risk of cognitive decline, whereas BP alone did not appear to have a significant predictive value. These findings highlight the contribution of vascular determinants in cognitive decline even in this very old population.",

The dosimetric results primarily favor IMRT planning in rectal cancer patients and consequently present the significant alteration in target volumes.",
    "Neuronal tissue and muscle tissue were more defective in the UVO group. The decrease in neuronal fibers and muscle cells explains the pathogenesis of the obstructive group, but no difference was observed regarding the accumulation of collagen type 3 and cellular apoptosis between the VUR and UVO groups. In the VUR group, renal functions decreased while the smooth muscle defect at the distal end of the ureter increased.",

    "Endoscopic treatment of VUR has satisfying outcomes in properly selected cases. Younger age (<54 months) and previous history of failed injection history were found to be related to unfavorable results. Postoperative UTI occurs more frequently in patients with persisting reflux, preoperative breakthrough infection history and girls. The choice of one of the dextranomer-based substances does not affect the surgical outcome and postoperative UTI development.",
    "The incidence of failed open pyeloplasty is as low as 5% and management remains controversial. As reported by other authors, we believe that crossing vessels play a particularly important role in secondary obstruction and adversely impact the outcome. Redo pyeloplasty, open or minimally invasive, is associated with high success rates (80-100%) and therefore considered the treatment of choice by the majority of authors nowadays. Additionally, RALP for secondary procedures has demonstrated to be safe and even less technically demanding when compared to the open approach, providing the advantages of minimally invasive surgery.",
    "Revision, which is the most common main endpoint used by arthroplasty registries, is not universally defined. This implies that some reoperations that are considered a revision in one registry are not considered a revision in another registry. Therefore, comparisons of implant performance using data from different registries have to be performed with caution. We suggest that registries work to harmonize their definitions of revision to help facilitate comparisons of results across the world's arthroplasty registries.",
    "Psychological status and HRQoL improved with decreasing pain and increasing functional ability from 3 months after surgery. Preoperative depression, anxiety, and insomnia did not predict poor outcome after rotator cuff repair. Our findings suggest that successful rotator cuff repair may improve psychological status and HRQoL.",

    "In the present study, we showed evidence that surgeon's experience has a strong positive impact on pathologic and functional outcomes as well as on operative time. While significant learning effects concerning positive surgical margin rate and preserved long-term continence were detectable during the first 750 and 300 procedures, respectively, improvement in operative time was detectable up to a threshold of almost 1000 RP and hence is relevant even for very high-volume surgeons.",

However, the present article indicates that these engines can reduce leg injuries among riders of motorcycles fitted with ABS. Though it is recommended that future research should look deeper into this particular aspect, the present findings suggest that the concept of integrated leg protection is indeed feasible and that further engineering efforts in this area are likely to yield significant savings in health losses among motorcyclists.",
    "The US valve has the advantage of facile manipulation of wires and baskets while maintaining a watertight seal, while other devices may be more cost-effective and secure. The PP has the advantage of less operator hand fatigue and ease of use, but the SAPS may allow for greater on-demand pressures.

    "By combining karyotyping and RNA sequencing, we identified the 2 first ever reported ALK rearrangements in CNS tumors. Such rearrangements may represent the hallmark of a new entity of pediatric glioma characterized by both ependymal and astrocytic features. Our findings are of particular importance because crizotinib, a selective ALK inhibitor, has demonstrated effect in patients with lung cancer harboring ALK rearrangements. Thus, ALK emerges as an interesting therapeutic target in patients with ependymal tumors carrying ALK fusions.",

    "Changing the QRS duration cut-point to 125 ms would increase the sensitivity of the screening ECG, without a significant increase in false-positives. However, changing the ST segment depression cut-point to 25 μV would lead to a significant increase in false-positives and would therefore not be justified.",
    "High surgical volume more strongly predicted overall patient satisfaction on the HCAHPS survey than postoperative outcomes, whereas volume was less predictive in other HCAHPS domains. Patients may require more specific questioning to identify high quality, safe hospitals.",
    "Cold loop hysteroscopic myomectomy seems to represent a safe and effective procedure for the removal of submucous myomas with intramural development, while at the same time respecting the anatomic and functional integrity of the myometrium. The use of a cold loop in resectoscopic myomectomy is associated with a low rate of minor intraoperative complications and an absence of major complications. This could be of primary relevance with a view to fertility and future pregnancies.",

    "The CRIB score had the largest AUC, resulting from its inclusion of FiO2. PREM(bm), as the most accurate score among those unaffected by early treatment, seems to be a good alternative for strict risk adjustment in NICU auditing. It could be useful to combine scores.",
    "There is a relationship between nuclear CSE1L overexpression and distant metastasis in breast cancer. CSE1L status may therefore become a valuable prognostic tool in the future.",
    "This study provides statistical evidence that one view is adequate and safe for majority of proximal femoral fractures. The lateral radiograph should not be performed on a routine basis thus making considerable saving in time and money, and avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure and discomfort to the patient.",
    "PLR is an independent predictor of invasive carcinoma. The addition of PLR as a criterion to the FCG and SCG significantly improved the predictive value of these guidelines in detecting invasive neoplasms.",
    "This is the first study examining rural-urban differences in maternal readmissions. The results indicate the importance of monitoring and potentially improving the quality of maternal care, especially when the delivery involves a C-section. More studies investigating rural health disparities in women's health are clearly necessary.",
    "The low b-factors-based ADC was an economical option for reducing the examination time without sacrificing its diagnostic performance.",
    "We conclude that routinely imaging the SIJ in MRI lumbar spine series is not cost-effective or a useful use of resources. The SIJ should be imaged only if significant clinical findings are demonstrated.",
    "Pediatric resident empathy did not decrease longitudinally, unlike studies in other residents. There was no inverse relation between self-perceptions of sense of power and empathy as is present in the business literature. Finally, pediatric resident empathy was significantly higher when compared with a general nonmedical population.",

    "CCT is significantly increased in type II diabetes mellitus patients with respect to controls. Retinal disease severity does not seem to have an effect on corneal thickness.",
    "Overall, there is no association between urodynamic findings and response to treatment with mirabegron. This may reflect the fact that mirabegron's mode of action mechanisms are not measurable using cystometry. In women with refractory symptoms, however, the presence of DO is associated with a positive response to treatment.",
    "There are distinct differences in clinicopathologic features and prognosis in patients with or without skip N2 metastasis. Considering the results of our study, subclassifications of mediastinal lymph node metastases could have clinical significance for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.",

    "The wide acceptance of tribal medicine suggests that tribal medicine needs to be supported. The results of the study question the process of the implementation of the 'mainstreaming AYUSH' policy for Meghalaya and highlight the importance of contextualizing health policy within the local culture. A potential role for Health Policy and Systems Research (HPSR) at sub-national levels is also highlighted.",
    "In a comparison with normal pregnant women, the rate of cerebral palsy is double among patients with preeclampsia, especially those with early-onset disease. Early-onset preeclampsia is an independent risk factor for cerebral palsy. Among women with preeclampsia, the presence of neonatal infectious morbidity, birth asphyxia, and complications of prematurity are independent risk factors for the development of cerebral palsy, which further supports the role of a multi-hit model in the pathogenesis of this syndrome.",
    "Among VA pneumonia readmissions, PPR categorisation did not produce the expected quality of care findings. Either PPR-yes cases are not more preventable, or preventability assessment requires other data collection methods to capture poorly documented processes (eg, direct observation).",
    "Based on our combined cell line and breast cancer extract data, we conclude that ADAM10 is likely to be involved in breast cancer progression, especially in the basal subtype.",
    "Neither the 4 Cs nor the surgeon's impression correlate with histological findings regarding muscle viability. In 72% of specimens, the treating surgeon's gross assessment differed from the histopathologic appearance. Although the fate of the debrided muscle remains unclear if left in situ, these results raise questions regarding current practices, including the possibility that surgeons are debriding potentially viable muscle.",
    "Combining our series and previous case reports, the presence of a large nodule adjacent to the right portal vein appears to be a common finding in ALGS. The typical location, normal α-fetoprotein levels, and magnetic resonance imaging features with vessels coursing through the lesion can reliably differentiate this benign nodule from hepatocellular carcinoma.",
    "Two distinct FD subtypes are identifiable in pediatric population. A high percentage of overlap and a variation of subtype over time were found, suggesting a common pathophysiologic mechanism.",
    "Although the majority of residents met the minimum standard for these cases, about 10% of residents did not meet the requirement for male urethral surgery. In addition, a review of learning curves for these procedures suggests that the ACGME minimum requirements may be insufficient to confer actual competency in skill. Increasing this number in training or specialized postgraduate training programs is needed to provide actual competency.",

    "This article generates several hypotheses, which should be confirmed with additional investigations. Until then it has to be concluded that patients who suffer from accidental blast injuries in the civilian setting (excluding military operations and terrorist attacks) show a combination of classical severe trauma with blunt and penetrating injuries and additionally a high proportion of severe burns (combined thermomechanical injury). They stay longer in the ICU than other trauma patients and suffer more complications, such as sepsis and multiorgan failure. Established scores, such as RISC, RISC II and TASH tend to underestimate the severity of the underlying trauma.",

    "Based on current available literature, this study represents the largest cohort with the longest follow-up reported on MLKI to date. At intermediate- to long-term follow-up, patients>30 years of age that undergo multiligament knee reconstruction for KD have inferior IKDC and Lysholm scores compared to those ≤30 years of age. However, successful multiligament knee reconstruction can still be obtained in this age group.",
    "The results partially replicate similar studies in health screening decisions. Reasons for the differences in results from those obtained in screening studies are considered. It is suggested that negative focussing may have less effect in decisions in which there are few risks. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Decision-making in the context of health behaviour change has been widely described, but there are few experimental studies testing hypothesised strategies. 'Non-directiveness' is often regarded as desirable because it supposedly allows exploration of the decision without influencing it. Previous studies on health screening (but not treatment) have shown that health decision outcomes can be systematically influenced by the way in which a 'non-directive' intervention is implemented. This can be accounted for by a modified subjective expected utility theory previously applied to both health screening and child vaccination decisions. What does this study add? The hypothetical decision about whether or not, in future, to take statins for elevated cholesterol levels was influenced by positive but not by negative focussing. Results were consistent with the theoretical framework. This study extends previous work on influences on the decision to undertake health screening and vaccination to treatment offered as secondary prevention. 'Non-directive' approaches to helping facilitate decisions can modify those decisions, and as such cannot be regarded as non-directive.",
    "The implementation of the FTC in GCA care appears to significantly reduce the risk of permanent visual impairment and is more cost effective by reducing the need for inpatient care.",
    "We concluded that first-year pediatric residents have inadequate skills in the delivery of bad news. In addition, our data suggest that higher EI alone is not sufficient to effectively deliver death news and more robust skill training is necessary for residents to gain competence and acquire mastery in this important communication domain.",
    "This investigation found evidence that while eating patterns clearly contribute to daily energy intake on weekdays and weekends, they may not necessarily contribute to weight change. At the end of the day, what may be most important is regular self-monitoring and total caloric intake on both the weekdays and weekends.",
    "Never-smokers with RRs of 15 to 35 have similar to better trade-offs between benefits and harms compared with ever-smokers recommended for lung cancer screening by the USPSTF guidelines. For most never-smokers, lung cancer screening is not beneficial.",
    "There was a statistically significant correlation of ACB and neuro-disability measures and LOS amongst this patient cohort.",
    "Low vitamin D is associated with rotaviral diarrhea. This is the first study in the literature to show this, and this result needs to be repeated in larger controlled clinical studies.",
    "Results suggest that disclosure of a terminal prognosis does not mean loss of patient hope. Instead, hope was redefined on a goal other than cure. Presenting patients with information and increasing their knowledge about care options and resources may facilitate patients in identifying meaningful goals that are better aligned with their prognosis.",
    "AMH levels seem to have a positive correlation and patient's age and LH levels had a negative correlation with the outcome of IUI and COS with gonadotropins. AMH concentration was significantly higher and LH was significantly lower in patients with a clinical pregnancy after three cycles of IUI treatment compared with those who did not achieve pregnancy.",
    "In the context of a mesothelial proliferation, the finding of homozygous deletion of p16 by FISH or loss of BAP1 by immunohistochemistry is, thus far, 100% specific for malignant mesothelioma. The limited sensitivity of each test may be improved to some extent by running both tests.",

    "Combination therapy of epinephrine injection and other modalities with hemoclips did not show advantage over hemoclipping alone in this prospective cohort study. However, there is a tendency to perform combination therapy in active bleeding which resulted in equivalent hemostatic success rate, and this reflects the role of combination therapy in clinical practice.",
    "Measurement of IVC diameters, especially EAP may be useful at the monitoring of critically ill patients in ED.",
    "The higher risk of mental health problems in ethnic minority groups can be partly accounted for by a lack of recovery opportunities at work, but not by perceived work stress. This may imply that workplace prevention targeting recovery opportunities have the potential to reduce ethnic inequalities, but ethnic-specific experiences at the workplace need to be further explored.",
    "Warming up prior to performing surgery does not make a difference for primary THA when performed by an experienced surgeon. However, these results may not reflect its effect on procedures that require fine motor skills or done by an orthopedic trainee or less experienced surgeons.",
    "These data show that increasing obesity does not impair the reproductive outcome in GC cycles. Larger sample size is indicated to verify these findings. Furthermore, this study suggests that the standard metabolic screening used for GCs may lead to selection of healthier patients compared with women of comparable BMI who conceive outside of a fertility clinic setting, indicating the metabolic profile, rather than BMI, may better explain differences in pregnancy outcomes.",
    "These findings underscore the need for policy to address rural transport problems in order to improve maternal health. Community based transport strategy with CHPS is proposed to improve adherence to referral and access to emergency obstetric services.",
    "In 2010-2012 in Britain, the proportion of young adults reporting chlamydia testing was generally higher in those reporting factors associated with chlamydia. However, many of those with risk factors had not been recently tested, leaving potential for undiagnosed infections. Greater screening and prevention efforts among individuals in deprived areas and those reporting risk factors for chlamydia may reduce undiagnosed prevalence and transmission.",

    "There were no significant differences in procedure time, charges, or safety in after-hours removal of non-emergent esophageal foreign bodies compared to removal during standard operating hours. OR wait time was about 4h longer during standard hours compared with after-hours. This study could not assess the factors to determine the impact in differences in hospital resource utilization or work force, which may be significant between these two groups.",

    "In our study, we identified several patients with RCC diagnosed shortly after surgery, which raised the possibility that this was present before transplantation. With transplant recipients at increased risk of development of RCC and early detection key in the management of RCC, there appears to be a role for native renal radiological screening for patients undergoing renal transplantation.",
    "Abnormal ultrasound, non-Hispanic race, and public insurance were strongly associated with hospital admission in children presenting to the ED with initial febrile urinary tract infection.",

    "Transvenous lead removal is highly successful, with few serious procedural complications. We propose a risk stratification scheme that may categorize patients as low, moderate, and high risk for lead extraction. Such a strategy may guide which extractions are best performed in the operating room.",
    "Current measures in the Netherlands to prevent women from developing cervical cancer hardly reach Somali women because these women perceive these kinds of preventative measures as not personally relevant. Dutch education strategies about cervical cancer deviate from ways of exchanging information within the Somali community. Teachers can provide culturally sensitive information to young Somali women in schools. For Somali mothers, oral education (e.g., poetry or theater) about the Dutch health care system and men's roles in HPV transmission may be useful. An intersectional approach, grounded in the HBM, is recommended to promote equal access to preventive health care for Somali women.",
    "Anterior fat pad removal did not decrease the risk of the occurrence of AF after CABG despite its safety and convenience, and it should not be used to prevent new-onset AF after CABG unless new evidence is provided.",
    "For women, the advantage of CABG surgery over DES is very similar to what was found for men, and this advantage persisted for patients with and without high-risk characteristics.",
    "Preoperative MRI significantly overestimated tumor size. Measurements obtained on US and MM were more accurate irrespective of breast density, with US measurements being slightly more accurate than MM measurements.",
    "The G-code functional limitation severity modifier system may not be valid for determining change in function and is not recommended for determining if patients have changed over the course of outpatient therapy.",
    "The piloted survey methodology achieved low participation rates. This approach is not suitable for population-based monitoring of chlamydia prevalence among young women in England.",
    "Large interstate variation in the relative magnitude of nonhomicide drug-intoxication deaths classified as suicide by medical examiners and coroners in the US appears partially an artifact of geographic region and degree of toxicological assessment in the case ascertainment process. Etiologic understanding and prevention of drug-induced suicides and other drug-intoxication deaths first require rigorous standardization involving accurate concepts, definitions, and case ascertainment.",
    "This study support the contributing and beneficial effects of vitamin D in the treatment of CU. Replacement of vitamin D may provide improvement in both the severity of symptoms and the quality of life scores in these patients.",
    "Left-sided varicoceles in adults are distinct from those in adolescents. In adults, reflux is likely to be induced via collateral pathways, whereas in adolescents congenital venous abnormalities are predominantly present. The higher prevalence and the greater diameter of a right insufficient ISV in adults, combined with the absence of venous anatomic differences, supports the hypothesis that right-sided varicocele is an evolutive disease.",

    "The nephrographic and excretory phases are complementary for the detection of upper tract urothelial carcinoma.",
    "Fibular fixation is not a necessary step in the reconstruction of pilon fractures, although it may be helpful in specific cases to aid in tibial plafond reduction or augment external fixation. We found a higher rate of plate removal if the fibula was fixed.",
    "Lower nadir Hct was associated with an increased risk of AKI, and the effect appears to be stronger among men than women. Understanding of the mechanism underlying this association remains uncertain, although these results suggest the need to limit exposure to lower nadir Hct, especially for male patients.",
    "Elderly patients with a higher degree of frailty appear to have greater levels of lipid peroxidation, which could be considered a marker of frailty.",
    "US may be useful in defining the cranial and posterior extensions, mainly when tumours are localized there. This study demonstrates that the now standard radio-opaque wires around the palpable breast may not be needed in breast contouring.",
    "Since the advent of EGS, more judicious use of diagnostic radiology, reduced complications, reduced LOS, reduced time to theatre and an increased rate of definitive management during the index admission were demonstrated.",
    "A simple prompt in the surgical admission document has significantly improved the documentation of pregnancy status and gynaecological history in our female patients, particularly in those who require surgical intervention. A number of patient safety concerns were addressed locally, but require a coordinated, interdisciplinary discussion and a national guideline. A minimum standard of care, in females of reproductive age, should include mandatory objective documentation of pregnancy status, whether or not they require surgical intervention.",
    "These results imply that the free primary education in the three African countries may not be sufficient and policies to keep girls in school beyond primary school hold more promise of addressing child undernutrition.",
    "This study has shown overlap in the methods national/local REA bodies in Europe have chosen for a pazopanib REA for renal cell carcinoma, except for the use and methods of indirect comparisons. Although some additional comparators and outcomes differed between national/local REAs, they can be captured in a comprehensive joint REA.",
    "LU can be found in women of any age, most of them sexually active. In most cases the lesions are preceded by non-gynecological symptoms and recurrence is common. Most lesions occur on the vestibule and labia minora, being rarely found isolated on the left side. Viruses seem to be the most frequent associated agents but Mycoplasma pneumoniae serology should be considered. In one case there was a possible role for PVB19. A standard protocol can effectively exclude sexually transmitted diseases and lead to a diagnosis in up to a third of cases.",
    "Within this sample, recall of the current, voluntary warning labels on Australian alcohol products was non-existent, overall awareness was low, and few people reported visiting the DrinkWise website. It appears that current warning labels fail to effectively transmit health messages to the general public.",
    "Current Belgian and Norwegian growth references for length/height were found to be largely unaffected by the current proportion of overweight and obese children. There is, therefore, no need for revised height charts that exclude overweight or obese children.",
    "The addition of septoplasty to oropharyngeal ambulatory surgical procedures does not significantly increase the rate of unplanned revisits or postoperative hemorrhage except in the case of septoplasty added to tonsillectomy, with a small percentage increase in hemorrhage rate. Combining septoplasty with ambulatory oropharyngeal surgery is clinically reasonable in adults.",
    "The results of this study demonstrated significant differences between the dialed in cut and \"actual\" bone resection achieved for all planes for both the femur and tibia. The femur sagittal cut demonstrated a tendency for an extended cut and the tibia showed a tendency for varus.",
    "The relocation of public health into local authorities exposes questions over prioritizing public health investment, including the balance across lifestyle interventions and broader action on social determinants of health and the extent to which the public health evidence base influences local democratic decision-making. Action on wider social determinants reinforces not only the art and science but also the values and politics of public health.",
    "Public attitudes towards allowing non-citizens to have access to publicly funded health care present high levels of variation, even among developed countries or countries with similar GDPs. The specific socio-economic conditions within a country and an individual's own social, demographic, and economic background can have different effects on the individual's attitudes towards non-citizens. On a global level, coverage of public health insurance plays an important role for enhancing the public's positive attitudes towards non-citizens' access to publicly funded health care. On a national level, health care policies tailored toward non-citizens based on the specific situation of each country and region are necessary.",
    "Chronic pramipexole treatment does not seem to affect autonomic balance during wakefulness. Considering that neither PSG data nor autonomic parameters are significantly modified by pramipexole, we hypothesize a non-dopaminergic autonomic dysfunction in RLS.",
    "The rate of meningocele associated with tethered cord syndrome is very high. MRI is necessary for the diagnosis of meningocele. Active surgical treatment is recommended immediately after definite diagnosis. During surgery, the surgeon should not only repair the protruded meninges but also explore the spinal canal and release the tethered cord.",
    "Based on our findings, a large percentage (66%) of women with double primary cancers of the colorectum and endometrium are likely to be diagnosed with Lynch syndrome.",
    "The HABER test is capable of reproducing familiar pain in SIJ-positive LBP individuals and has moderate levels of sensitivity and specificity for identifying SIJ-positive LBP individuals.",
    "Chronic depressive symptoms were not associated with cancer incidence. In contrast, new-onset symptoms were associated with a substantially increased risk, possibly due to reverse causality.",
    "In focused comparisons, the data demonstrate that the NSQIP-P sampling algorithm successfully identifies CPT codes with higher postoperative event rates than the overall cohort of pediatric GTPS patients, but may not be reflective of the total experience for procedures with those CPT codes.",
    "This study suggests that how older adults perceive death partly determines whether they have a wish to die. There may be a clinical, patient-oriented benefit in discussing with older patients about how they perceive death, as this can play a role in the early detection (and prevention) of death or suicide ideation and associated behaviors in older adults.",
    "Intranasal fentanyl seems to be efficient for analgesia in adult patients with renal colic.",
    "Laparoscopic bariatric surgery is safe and can be performed with acceptable perioperative outcomes in extremely high-risk patients. Advanced age, BMI, and severe cardiopulmonary comorbidities should not exclude patients from consideration for bariatric surgery.",
    "Our findings support a theory of impaired social-cognitive functions in the early stages of HD. Test performances decreased with increasing disease burden in all HD gene expansion carriers, suggesting that social-cognitive tests may be useful for tracking disease progression. Simple emotion recognition tasks are just as sensitive for measuring social-cognitive deficits as more complex measures, but knowledge of the quality of social-cognitive impairments in HD can be of great importance to both patients and caregivers.",
    "Shunt series detected catheter pathology only 3.9% of the time, and there was no difference in the rate of management changes between those patients who underwent a shunt series and those who did not. There was a significant difference in the rate of management changes in patients who received shunt patency studies as compared to those who did not. Shunt series may not be a useful screening tool to be used universally to diagnose shunt malfunction in IIH patients in the ED, and should be utilized when there is concern for impending visual loss. Shunt patency studies should be reserved for patients with inconclusive diagnostic imaging and clinical findings to decide whether to proceed to surgical exploration and revision.",
    "Despite increased concerns about substance abuse, the majority of programs did not have substance abuse and diversion policies or report screening all patients, with screening of caregivers rarely reported. Consensus guidelines addressing substance abuse and diversion for palliative patients are needed to address this growing problem.",
    "No suprastenotic dilatation was seen in 0.8% of patients with organic bile flow impairment. In these cases, obstacles to bile flow may be suggested by clear-cut variations in the diameter of the hepaticocholedoch and its deformity. The absence of suprastenotic dilatation may be partly explained by excessive metastatic liver involvement and malignant hepatoduodenal ligament infiltration. When suprastenotic dilatation is absent, instrumental palpation and diagnostic and therapeutic stenting may be used for the differential diagnosis of obstructive and hepatic jaundices.",
    "PA levels of people with SCI in Switzerland are rather high. However, some subgroups need special consideration when planning interventions to increase PA levels.",
    "The results of all measurement methods were close to each other. The most sensitive and specific method was home measurement when compared with ambulatory measurement. But both office and pharmacy measurements had also high sensitivity and specificity.",
    "Baseline diabetic control does not appear to be an independent predictor for depression outcomes at 6 months. The best predictor of diabetic control after the diagnosis of depression was previous control of diabetes.",
    "An exclusion from surgical therapy due to advanced age in general seems not to be justified. However, the decision for a surgical resection in patients over 80 years should be made with caution. pNM-categories and R0-resection remain the most important predictive factors for overall survival in all subgroups. No survival benefit for neoadjuvant treatment in patients over 70 years was found, while women survived longer than men. However, the decision concerning a (radio) chemotherapy should be made individually in each patient.",
    "Faith community leaders envisioned a role for faith communities in addressing childhood obesity. Findings support the ongoing development of population based health promotion programs through faith community engagement. The findings provide a foundation for nurses partnering with faith communities on health promotion programs targeting childhood obesity to address family health issues in a holistic way.",
    "There were few differences in pain scores and morphine use between the surgical and nonoperative groups, and the differences observed likely were not clinically important. We found no evidence that surgical stabilization of certain LC1 and LC2 pelvic fractures improves patients' pain, decreases their narcotic use, and improves time to mobilization. A randomized trial of patients with similar fractures and similar degrees initial displacement would help remove some of the confounders present in this study.",
    "These findings provide insight into how conveying imprecision information influences patient treatment choices.",
    "The use of preoperative MBP does not seem to be associated with lower incidence of intra-abdominal septic complications after LCR.",
    "More LE than ME SLTs could offer remediation in an African language, but there were few other significant differences between the two groups. There is still an absence of appropriate assessment and remediation material for Afrikaans and African languages, but the increased number of African language speakers entering the profession may contribute to better service delivery to the diverse South African population.",

    "We were unable to demonstrate a relationship between perceived difficulty in decision making in the surrogate role and receptivity to clinical trial participation.",
    "Emergent CABG within 24 hours of non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction is associated with in-hospital mortality and long-term outcomes similar to those of CABG performed after 3 days, despite a higher risk profile. CABG performed between 24 to 72 hours showed a nonsignificant trend toward poorer long-term outcomes. Dual antiplatelet therapy until surgery is beneficial, whereas renal insufficiency and left main disease increase the risk of early and late death.",
    "A PI strategy appears to alter the pattern of IS after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, resulting in more medium and fewer large infarcts compared with PPCI. Despite a comparable number of small infarcts, PI patients in this group had more aborted myocardial infarctions and less 30-day shock and congestive heart failure.",

    "Diagnostic labels may negatively impact on clinicians' judgments and perceptions of individuals and therefore clinicians should think carefully about whether, and how, they use diagnoses and efforts should be made to destigmatize diagnostic terms.",
    "The WHO guidelines were only partially implemented, with significant differences between hospitals in level of implementation of recommended practices. Given the benefits expected from the application of the guidelines, efforts should be made for the establishment and promotion of a single national policy for LBW feeding that follows the WHO new guidelines and streamlines the LBW feeding practices across the country.",
    "Even if the new primer pair 341F/785R seemed promising in silico, it was less sensitive for 16S rDNA amplification in heart valves than the 91E/13BS pair already used. This study underlines a lack of standardization for 16S rDNA amplification for clinical samples.",
    "A major improvement in patient access to primary care clinics was associated with increased use and continuity of primary care for patients with 3 chronic conditions, but did not affect overall resource use.",
    "Patients' sedation decisions are not influenced by preceding patients' decisions. Most patients attending for out-patient gastroscopy have already decided about sedation.",
    "In this particular group of IVF patients, AMH is the best single marker of ovarian response to gonadotrophin stimulation. The combined markers modestly improved the prediction.",
    "In Mexico, the lack of association between induced abortion and tubal damage causing infertility observed in this population might be explained by a shift toward \"safer\" abortion practices.",
    "Cryopreserved epididymal and testicular sperm, from men with obstructive azoospermia, appear equally effective in ICSI. Epididymal recovery should remain the method of first choice for obstructive azoospermic men but further study of sperm DNA damage rates in different testicular sites is required.",
    "Residual urine volume is an indicator of the completeness of PANP during TME. It should be determined pre- and post-operatively, and besides the recording of the neurogenic bladder, serve as a quality control.",
    "Physician representation in Congress is low and is in stark contrast with physician roles during the first century of the United States. However, the 8 physicians currently serving in Congress may be indicative of a shift toward more direct influence of physicians in national politics.",
    "Gallbladder carcinoma extending into the subserosa or beyond invades the hepatoduodenal ligament with relatively high frequency. Preoperative diagnosis of this invasion is difficult; therefore, strong consideration should be given to resection of the extrahepatic bile ducts and lymph nodes.",
    "There were no statistically significant differences in RLN paralysis, paresis, or total injury rates between control and NIM groups, even in subsets with advanced T-stage and increased baseline risk. Advanced T-stage is a significant predictor of RLN paresis in this cohort.",
    "At the present time, it is not possible to predict recurrence using parameters of age, sex, extent of disease, and serum IgE levels. Larger number of patients preferably in a prospective multicenter meta study are required to address this issue. Though use of systemic corticosteroid does not decrease the incidence of recurrence, it may delay the onset of recurrence and decrease the severity of recurrence.",
    "The use of muscle relaxants improves the intubation conditions and may help to avoid unnecessary high doses of anesthetics in hemodynamic unstable emergency patients. This study shows that rocuronium might be an alternative to succinylcholine for RSI also in prehospital emergency medicine, if succinylcholine is contraindicated.",
    "The results of our study show that in North-Eastern Poland, Ixodes ricinus is not essential in Francisella tularensis transmission in this region.",
    "There was no clear difference in patient-centred effectiveness measures between occupational therapists and social workers in assessing frail older people and their carers in the community. More extensive use of primary care health services by occupational therapists may have contributed to the differences in EQ-5D scores for carers. Delays in making occupational therapy assessments and in completing recommended housing adaptations may have contributed to these negative findings.",
    "IE has acceptable sensitivity for lymph node macrometastases, but it is a weak tool for diagnosing micrometastases. FS and TP are roughly equivalent. IE allows management changes, because approximately 20% of all patients are expected to undergo synchronous axillary dissection, and it is particularly helpful in T2 patients. This may allow substantial cost savings for the health-care system.",
    "Mean compliance rates were higher than those reported in the literature but varied as a function of patient care activity and occupation of the HCW. A reinforced in-service educational program will be implemented that will target especially physicians and medical students. Self-assessment method, easy to use and inexpensive, gave encouraging results. The development of a broad-based, routine, self-assessment program is underway at Nantes University Hospital, but, before such a program can be implemented, reproducibility of these self-assessment indicators must be further confirmed.",
    "No striking differences in toxicity appeared between the two etoposide formulations, but this retrospective study seemed to confirm the appearance of particular cutaneous and anal side effects especially with two associations: (1) etoposide-ifosfamide (OS 94 and Ewing 97), and (2) etoposide-ifosfamide-Adriamycin-vincristine (VIDE course of the Euro-Ewing 99 protocol).",

    "Only MCD removes pCyst, but the amount of removal is different for other low molecular weight proteins (prolactin and parathyroid hormone) and similar for creatinine, a classic 'little molecule'. In view of the discrepancy of these findings, the use of pCyst in hemodialysis still seems premature and needs further studies.",
    "In this large cohort, breast-feeding for>12 months was inversely related to the development of RA. This apparent effect was dose-dependent, with a significant trend toward lower risk with longer duration of breast-feeding. Irregular menstrual cycles and earlier age at menarche increased the risk of RA. Other reproductive hormonal factors were not associated with RA risk.",
    "These data support the link between inflammation, immune response, and dyslipoproteinemia in SLE, introducing anti-LPL as a possible new player that may ultimately help in understanding the complex events of atherogenesis in this disease.",
    "Nine- and 10-year-olds understand commutativity, but are unable to use the distributive principle in multiplication. Their errors suggest that they may confuse some of the principles of multiplication with those of addition. When children do begin to understand the principle of distributivity, they most easily apply it in the context of Isomorphism of measures multiplication problems. The implications for mathematical education are discussed.",
    "Promoter hypermethylation of the GSTP1 gene is a highly specific--but not a very sensitive--marker of prostate cancer. Our data showed a significant association between the methylation status of the GSTP1 gene and Gleason score and grade, suggesting a potential prognostic value of this epigenetic DNA alteration.",

    "There is some evidence of an association at electoral ward level between hospital admissions for falls and socio-economic deprivation, with higher rates in deprived areas. No such association was found for hip fracture. Further work is required to assess the impact of interventions on reducing inequalities in hospital admission rates for falls in elderly people.",
    "Socially anxious children may not necessarily display social skill deficits. However, they may believe that they appear nervous during social encounters. Clinicians should consider using CBT techniques to address these concerns, rather than relying on social skill remediation.",
    "This study has established that, among incentives for postal questionnaires, one big prize improves the yield more than many small prizes despite the lower odds of winning. It has also confirmed that offering a modest incentive to GPs generates good response rates for postal questionnaires.",

    "Legally \"safe\" BAC markedly worsen sleepiness-impaired driving in women. However, they seem to be aware of their impaired driving and are able to judge the degree of risk entailed. Such an attitude may contribute to the lower incidence of sleep- or alcohol-related crashes in women compared with men.",
    "The incidence of gastroschisis presenting at PAH and KH has risen dramatically relative to the incidence of the macroscopically similar exomphalos over the period 1981 - 2001, with the incidence of gastroschisis rising above the incidence of exomphalos. A larger scale study looking at birth prevalence of gastroschisis and exomphalos in South Africa is necessary to determine whether this represents a true differential change in the incidence of gastroschisis, reflecting internationally observed increases in the birth prevalence of this defect, or whether it is merely due to logistical changes within the administration of the Department of Health serving the area.",
    "Addition of diagnostic laparoscopy combined with peritoneal cytology and minimally invasive palliation procedures (endoscopic biliary prosthesis, laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy) to the staging-protocol for pancreatic carcinoma may decrease operative lethality and unnecessary laparotomies may be avoided safely. As unexpected subglissonian micrometastases may additionally be present in 5-10%, perioperative laparoscopy is always advisable.",
    "Our results have demonstrated that morbidities after internal or external diversion were minimal in cases of malignant obstruction. However, patients scheduled to receive an IUS should be more carefully monitored for ongoing obstruction than patients scheduled for PCN tube placement.",

    "The results suggest that in regular care, patients' needs with respect to glycaemic control are recognised by their diabetologists, but patients with high psychosocial diabetes-related distress are often overlooked, though they also may be in need of additional care. Integrated monitoring of diabetes-related distress in outpatients could improve this area of diabetes care.",
    "Increased dose to at-risk structures occurred when individualized treatment planning was not performed. Since a significant increase in dose to the rectum (p = 0.038) and bladder (p = 0.006) was obtained without customized treatment planning, we continue to advocate individualized treatment planning in HDR tandem and ovoid insertions for the treatment of cervix cancer.",
    "CD151 has an increasing expression pattern in prostate cancer progression, and higher levels of CD151 are associated with poorer prognosis. CD151 had better predicting value for the clinical outcome of prostate cancer patients than does the traditional histologic grading method (Gleason grading).",
    "No direct benefit of neuroactive HAART therapy was found in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. However, in neuropsychologically impaired patients, there was a benefit in memory function.

    "To our knowledge this is the first report of rosuvastatin-induced pancreatitis. The occurrence of pancreatitis with two different statins in our patient argues that statins induced pancreatitis may be a class-effect of statins. With statin prescriptions on the rise clinicians need to be aware of this complication of statin treatment and remember that the newest statin, rosuvastatin is not dissimilar to the other statins in causing pancreatitis.",
    "Intermittent (self-) catheterisation is a safe and valuable technique in older people with significant post-void residuals owing to detrusor underactivity. Urinary continence is restored, urge, daytime frequency and nocturia are decreased, and the urinary tract infection rate is diminished, resulting in improved quality of life. Therefore, intermittent (self-) catheterisation is strongly recommended in older people.",

    "The anatomical distribution of colorectal cancer has been fairly stable at this hospital with no evidence of a shift towards the proximal colon. No differences were identified in the tumour distribution with respect to gender and age at diagnosis. Our findings support the initial application of flexible sigmoidoscopy for investigating patients with suspected colorectal malignancy and follow up colonoscopy for selected patients to exclude right sided pathology.",

    "Gyrus Plasmasect TURP yielded comparable results to monopolar TURP; however, this is only a preliminary study and follow-up is necessary to assess its long-term efficacy.",
    "BNS after transurethral prostate surgery is a significant problem. It is clear from our study that resection in small prostates with no sign of a high bladder neck will increase the development of BNS. Thus, small prostates should be managed by an initial bladder neck incision, even if the bladder neck is not high.",
    "The results show that positive patch test reactions to euro coins can be obtained from nickel-sensitized individuals after 48 h of application to the palmar skin under occlusion. These results do not contradict other experiments in which repeated handling of coins was unable to provoke fingertip allergic contact dermatitis. A dose-response relationship is a credible explanation to support such potential discrepancies.",
    "Compete rectal wall tumor eradication does not necessarily imply complete response, because the mesorectum may harbor tumor cells. Thus, caution should be exercised when considering the avoidance of radical surgery. Reliable imaging methods and clinical predictors for favorable outcome are important to allow less radical approaches in the future.",
    "Conversion of a laparoscopic colectomy does not result in inappropriately prolonged operative times, increased morbidity or length of stay, increased direct costs, or unexpected readmissions compared with similarly complex laparotomies. A policy of commencing most cases suitable for a laparoscopic approach laparoscopically offers patients the benefits of a laparoscopic colectomy without adversely affecting perioperative risks.",

To our knowledge this study represents the largest of its kind, but longer followup and other confirmatory studies are needed.",
    "Contractions of DO are felt by some of the patients and they differ from those patients who do not feel such contractions. It is likely that this finding reflects the existence of different OAB conditions with a different neuropathological cause and a different treatment outcome. Therefore, we suggest that specific tests for the evaluation of sensation in the lower urinary tract should be part of the diagnosis of patients with DO and symptoms of OAB.",
    "When the malignancy is confined to the adrenal gland, LA seems to be a feasible option if the principles of oncological surgery are respected. Nevertheless, further investigations are required to evaluate the appropriateness of this operation.",
    "The lack of accurate methods for diagnosing SLOH suggests that a therapeutic trial of T supplementation is warranted in men in whom there are no contraindications. The 3-month period largely circumvents the placebo effect and has minimal risks for serious adverse effects (mostly in relation to prostate safety). This controversial position needs further evaluation with a larger cohort and other biochemical measurements.",

    "A 100% and 90.3% fusion rate was obtained for one-level nonplated and plated ACDF procedures with autograft, respectively. The effects of smoking or level of fusion could not be discerned from these one-level cases. Excellent and good clinical outcome results were obtained for 91.3%. Nonplating or rigid plate fixation for ACDF in properly selected patients to treat radiculopathy with or without myelopathy has a high fusion rate and yields a satisfactory clinical outcome. Although controversy exists as to the efficacy of rigid plate fixation in one-level ACDF, solid bone fusion can be adequately obtained without plate fixation and instrumentation-related complications can be avoided. In line with the literature, plate fixation should be reserved for patients unwilling or unable to wear a hard orthosis postoperatively for an extended period of time or for those patients who seek a quicker return to normal activities. Proper patient selection, meticulous operative technique and postoperative care is essential to promote optimal graft-host incorporation.",

    "Health counseling for diet, exercise, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention, tobacco use, and injury prevention are more likely to be provided at nonillness care visits involving an NP than at those not involving an NP. The presence of an NP is associated not only with higher rates of counseling for diet, exercise, and tobacco use provided at patient visits for chronic problems but also with higher rates of counseling for diet and HIV/STD prevention provided at patient visits for acute problems.",

    "We do not find support for the hypothesis that children and pregnant women who use private care are less likely to receive public health services. Results are consistent with the notion that Indian households are able to successfully navigate the coexisting public and private systems, and obtain services selectively from each. However, because the study employed an observational, cross-sectional study design, findings should be interpreted cautiously.",
    "Patients with AASV have raised circulating cytokine levels compared with healthy controls, even during remission. Raised IL-8 seems associated with poor prognosis. Lower levels of IL-10 and higher levels of IL-6 herald a greater risk of relapse. Patients with systemic vasculitis in clinical remission have persistent disease activity, kept under control by inhibitory cytokines.",
    "For the first time in German-speaking countries, this study provides evidence for the effectiveness of acute day hospital treatment as compared to conventional inpatient treatment.

This study supports the use of echocardiography in screening for LVSD in chronic stable patients after AMI or alternative high risk patients, with few differences of major clinical significance likely to occur.",
    "While further research is required to determine fully the processes of change, this study shows that a focus on general cognitive skills and positive changes to the social environment of the school can have a substantial impact on important health risk behaviours.",
    "Adipose tissue is a common feature of normal entheses and should not be regarded as a sign of degeneration. It contributes to the increase in surface area of attachment sites, promotes movement between tendon/ligament and bone, and forms part of an enthesis organ that dissipates stress. The presence of numerous nerve endings in fat at attachment sites suggests that it has a mechanosensory role and this could account for the rich innervation of many entheses. Because damage to fat is known to lead to considerable joint pain, our findings may be important for understanding the site of pain in enthesopathies.",

The introgression would be unilateral, with I. perado as the male donor, and the paternal sequences would be rapidly converted in highly divergent and consequently unidentifiable pseudogenes. At least, this study allows the establishment of precautionary measures when nuclear markers are used in phylogenetic studies of genera having experienced introgression such as the genus Ilex.",

    "In clinical practice, the MLD can be used to predict lung toxicity of a treatment plan, except for dose values that could lead to severe side effects. In the latter mentioned case, limitations to the predictive value of the MLD are possible. Such severe developments of a radiation-induced pneumopathy are better predicted by the NTCPlung formalism. The predictive advantage of this parameter compared to the MLD seems to remain in the evaluation and comparison of widely differing dose distributions, like in the investigated trial.",

With the prostheses with mobile RC, cervical curvature was readjusted under a low follower load. The SA-V and BS-FS designs exhibited better performances in the entire segmental stiffness and in the stability of the operative level than the BS-MI and BS-FI designs in flexion. The 5 designs demonstrated varying advantages relative to the stress distribution in the facet cartilages and on the bone-implant interface.",

    "RDW was an independent predictor of mortality. The addition of RDW to APACHE III improved its mortality prediction marginally. The underlying mechanism of RDW elevation warrants further investigation.",
    "We found a complex pattern of similarities and differences between databases. Overall treatment effect estimates were not statistically different, adding to a growing body of evidence that different UK PCDs produce comparable effect estimates. However, individually the two studies lead to different conclusions regarding the safety of β-blockers and some subgroup effects differed significantly. Single studies using even internally well-validated databases do not guarantee generalisable results, especially for subgroups, and confirmatory studies using at least one other independent data source are strongly recommended.",

    "Bladder autoaugmentation in a rabbit model, followed by intravesical balloon inflation offers improvement in bladder capacity and compliance. The use of sprayable adhesion barrier hydrogel technology may facilitate tissue healing and result in it being easier to maintain the success achieved by surgery when only supported with an intravesical balloon.",
    "The present study showed a high prevalence of US inflammatory abnormalities in the knee joints of a normal aged population. These data suggest a substantial contribution of inflammation in progressive impairment of joint function with age.",
    "Participants reported conflict because of the contradictory domains in which they work. They were comfortable working with patients at the EOL when death was expected, particularly in dementia. By contrast, they struggled with death as an adverse outcome in circumstances influenced by mental health culture, which was characterised by risk management, suicide prevention and a focus on recovery. This study has implications for models of care underpinning old age psychiatry. An integrated person-centred model of care may provide a contextually appropriate approach for practice.",
    "Supermarkets and their food sales strategies contribute to changing food consumption habits and nutritional outcomes. Yet the types of outcomes differ by age cohort and initial nutritional status. Simple conclusions on whether supermarkets are good or bad for nutrition and public health are not justified.",
    "The degree of reduction of the angle of the infundibular recess of the third ventricle correlated with the amount of third ventricular decompression after ETV. Most importantly, such a reduction was noted to occur during the early postoperative period when radiologic changes are less pronounced. Assessment of change in infundibular recess angle measurement is easy to perform and may prove helpful in cases with no clear-cut clinical evidence of success of ETV.",
    "Computerized patient cases facilitate practice-oriented teaching and result in an interesting and engaging learning model with improved learning outcomes.",
    "Although prematurity, opioid exposure and neonatal pain were significantly associated with brain volume, no major associations with neuropsychological functioning or thermal sensitivity were detected. Our findings suggest that morphine administration during neonatal life does not affect neurocognitive performance or thermal sensitivity during childhood in children born preterm without brain damage during early life. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "Patients with clearly resectable de novo HC should be treated with resection because there is no evidence that they would fare better with LTX. Patients with locally unresectable de novo HC, meeting criteria for our protocol, should be treated with LTX. The decision to proceed with RTX or LTX for patients with borderline resectable de novo HC remains difficult, but our results suggest that patients with B-C type IV HC might be best treated with transplantation, if they are excellent transplant candidates.",
    "Head CTA is commonly used after blunt TBI but does not alter management and should be abandoned in the absence of clear indications.",
    "In individuals without predisposing immunodeficiency and where cancer was not suspected, we found that pathologic analysis of circumcision specimens identified no additional malignancies. Our data suggest that in this normal risk population, pathologic analysis may not be required. Additionally, forgoing pathology on foreskin specimens in lower risk cases may reduce costs to the health care system.",

    "In patients with NIDCM and recurrent sustained VTs, a complete ablation of all inducible VTs may be achieved in 60% of the cases. The complete noninducibility may be a preferable end point of ablation because it was associated with better long-term success. Importantly, if possible to achieve through ablation, a complete VT noninducibility was associated with reduction of the likelihood for all-cause mortality in patients with NIDCM.",

The collaboration of everyone is necessary to improve the quality of medical issues on Wikipedia.",
    "Prolonged retraction time and coincident increases in t-EMG thresholds are predictors of declining nerve integrity. Increasing t-EMG thresholds, while predictive of injury, were also observed in a large number of patients without iatrogenic injury, with a greater predictive value in cases with extended duration. In addition to a careful approach with minimal muscle retraction and consistent lumbar plexus directional retraction, the incidence of postoperative motor neuropraxia may be reduced by limiting retraction time and utilizing t-EMG throughout retraction, while understanding that the specificity of this monitoring technique is low during initial retraction and increases with longer retraction duration.",
    "The risk of colorectal adenoma increases in patients with sporadic gastric hyperplastic polyps, and surveillance colonoscopy for these patients should be considered.",
    "Visceral osteopathic treatment of the abdomen did not accelerate meconium excretion in VLBW (very low birth weight)-infants. However infants in the osteopathic group had a longer time to full enteral feedings and a longer hospital stay, which could represent adverse effects. Based on our trial results, we cannot recommend visceral osteopathic techniques in VLBW-infants.",
    "A significant proportion of patients treated with the conventional dosage of ATV (300/100) had plasma concentrations exceeding the upper therapeutic threshold. These patients that are at high risk to experience ATV-related complications may benefit from TDM-driven adjustments in ATV dosage with potential advantages in terms of costs and toxicity.",

    "This study identified counties in California where large portions of the population may bear additional type 2 diabetes risk due to increased genetic prevalence of a susceptibility genotype. This type of screening can easily be extended to include information on environmental contaminants of interest and other related diseases, and potentially enables the rapid identification of potential environmental justice communities. Other potential uses of this approach include problem formulation in support of risk assessments, land use planning, and prioritization of site cleanup and remediation actions.",

    "The patients in the plate-fixation group recovered faster than the patients in the intramedullary nailing group, but the groups had similar results at six months postoperatively and the time of final follow-up. The rate of complications requiring revision surgery was low. Implant-related complications occurred frequently and could often be treated by implant removal.",
    "Individuals living in deprived neighbourhoods have poorer health, but it appears that neighbourhood deprivation is not causing poorer health of adults.

    "Nonadherence is a real problem in pediatric patients. Specific questionnaires can be an excellent reliable method for the routine follow-up of these children, and drug level assay can be requested only for confirmation. This protocol is especially effective in developing countries where financial resources may be limited. Every effort should be made to uncover its true incidence, contributing factors, and best methods of intervention.",
    "Most cases in cluster X with available results of TB-screening were already infected at arrival, indicating that their disease could be due to endogenous reactivation, rather than recent transmission after arrival to Norway. TB-status upon arrival was unknown for many of the other immigrants due to lack of initial screening. The reasons why conduction of the initial screening among other immigrants is failing should be explored and methods to simplify the TB screening at arrival should be implemented.",

    "The present study suggested SRS to be a potentially effective and minimally invasive treatment option for BM from SCLC either alone or after failed WBRT. Although repeat salvage treatment was needed in nearly half of patients to achieve control of distant BM, such continuation of radiotherapeutic management might contribute to reducing the rate of neurological death.",
    "Several PFs were identified as important in the life stories of people with RA, but only 55% of the PROMS covered some of these PFs. When evaluating PFs important to people with RA, health professionals should be alert on which PROMs can be used to assess which PFs.",

As efforts to report CQI accelerate, more attention to approaches to dissemination may be warranted in order to increase awareness in the chronically ill population.",
    "Our findings add to the available evidence that obesity might specifically be associated with the onset of multiple episodes of major depression (MDD-R). Although the reverse association was not found, MDD-R tends to be also associated with subsequent development of obesity, but larger studies are needed to fully assess this issue. The heterogeneity of MDD should be considered when examining the effect of obesity on MDD.",

    "Reduced central respiratory drive was infrequently reason of failed weaning attempts but it must be considered especially in patients with hypercapnia secondary to inefficient gas exchange and slow breathing. Our results in the clinical setting suggest that, the use of donepezil can expedite weaning presumably by stimulation of respiratory center and obviate the need to re-intubation in cases of respiratory drive problem in difficult to wean patients. We suggest decrease PCO2 and HCO3 during donepezil steady could be valuable predictors for positive response to donepezil intervention.",
    "Intensive care patients with VAP are more severely ill than non-VAP patients following CS. Nevertheless, patients with non-VAP and VAP following CS have similar outcomes. This study suggests that the empiric antibiotic regimen in patients with pneumonia following CS should include at least a broad-spectrum antibiotic targeting non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli, regardless of the type of pneumonia, and targeting S. aureus in VAP patients.",

    "Qualitative observation of these particles in vivo shows that dispersed PEG-coated particles are able to reach the absorptive tissues of the intestine while agglomerated uncoated particles are sequestered in the lumen of these tissues. However, the large differences observed for in vivo agglomeration behavior were not reflected in oral absorption, as indicated by gold tissue levels. Additional factors, such as surface chemistry, may have played a more important role than in vivo particle size and should be investigated further.",
    "This is the first qualitative study to explore GPs' views around an increased role for PNs in chlamydia testing. Despite the concerns raised by PNs, these findings suggest that GPs support the concept and recognise that PNs are suited to the role. However issues raised, such as funding and remuneration may act as barriers that will need to be addressed before PNs are supported to make a contribution to increasing chlamydia testing rates in general practice.",

    "The existence of certain moral positions in the views of society does not ethically imply, and pragmatically cannot mean, that all are translated into policy. Our findings highlight normative tensions and the importance of critically engaging with these normative issues (in addition to the current focus on a procedural justice approach to health policy). Future research should focus on i) the extent to which these perspectives are supported in society, ii) how respondents' perspectives relate to specific resource allocation questions, and iii) the characteristics of respondents associated with each perspective.",

    "Adoption and usage of the guidelines for the development of comprehensive multiyear plans for national immunization programmes were rapid. However, our findings show substantial variation between the proposed planning ideals set out in the guidelines and actual use in practice. A better understanding of factors that influence how recommendations in public health guidelines are applied in practice could contribute to improvements in guidelines design. It could also help adjust strategies used to introduce them into public health programmes, with the ultimate goal of a greater health impact.",

    "Empiric first and second-line triple treatments have unacceptable eradication rates in the central region of Portugal and cannot be used, according to Maastricht recommendations. Even for cases with no H. pylori resistance to the used antibiotics, results were unacceptable and, at least for CLARI, are influenced by history of frequent infections and tobacco consumption.",
    "Previously, we showed that motor cortex excitability is lower in patients with high post-stroke fatigue. Our current findings suggest that post-stroke fatigue (1) is a problem of movement speed (possibly a consequence of diminished motor cortex excitability) and not movement preparation, and (2) may have a focal origin confined to the lesioned hemisphere. We suggest that low motor cortex excitability in the lesioned hemisphere is a viable therapeutic target in post-stroke fatigue.",

In this survey sample, trainee knowledge of geriatric issues such as delirium and mental capacity was poor. Surgical trainees support the concept of closer liaison and shared care of complex, older patients with geriatric medicine physicians. Changes to surgical training and service development are needed.",
    "TUG times were significantly and independently associated with future falls. The ability of TUG to predict future falls was limited but with high specificity and negative predictive value.

    "Although PHCs are intended to be inclusive and participatory, in practice they seem to have little impact on the health policymaking process in Brazil. PHCs will only be able to fulfil their mandate when we see good governance largely present. This will require a rethinking of their governance structures, processes, membership, and oversight. If change is resisted, the PHCs will remain largely limited to a good idea in theory that is disappointing in practice.",
    "Our findings suggest that the MIP may have improved utilization and reduce costs incurred by patients with acute health needs, while chronic patients marginally benefit only during exacerbation of their illnesses. This suggests that the MIP did not adequately address the needs of the aging Georgian population where chronic illnesses are prevalent. Increasing MIP benefits, particularly for patients with chronic illnesses, should receive priority attention if universal coverage objectives are to be achieved.",

    "Overall, ACT knowledge among frontline health care providers is very poor. This finding suggests that efforts are needed to improve knowledge of prescribers and dispensers working in first-level health care facilities, perhaps through implementing focused, provider-oriented training programmes. Additionally, a system for regularly monitoring and evaluating the quality of in-service training may be beneficial to ensure its responsiveness to the needs of the target health care providers.",
    "Despite a formal patient safety curriculum concerning medication errors, 89% of medical students did not identify an overdose of a commonly used over the counter medication during a standardized patient simulation. Further educational interventions are needed for students to detect medication errors. Additionally, 31% of students did not ask about the administration of over the counter medications suggesting that students may not view such medications as equally important to prescription medications. Simulation may serve as a useful tool to assess students' competency in identifying medication administration errors.",

    "The overall rate of symptomatic infection with FM implantation in this study is 7.7%, with one third requiring hospital admission. This exceeds the reported rates in other FM implantation series, but is in keeping with the larger prostate biopsy literature. Given the higher than expected complication rate, a risk-adaptive approach may be helpful. Where higher accuracy is important such as stereotactic prostate radiotherapy, the benefits of FM may still outweigh the risks. For others, a non-invasive approach for prostate IGRT such as cone-beam CT could be considered.",
    "We find that GPs' preferences for private practice vs. salaried positions have changed substantially in the last few years, with a significant shift towards salaried contracts. With the proportions of GPs remaining fairly similar across private practice and salaried positions, there is an increasing discrepancy between GPs' current contract and their preferred one.",

    "Time trends in physical activity differed between boys and girls. Second-grade boys and fifth-grade girls were stable throughout, whereas second-grade girls increased from 2000 to 2006 before stabilising. Fifth-grade boys showed a significant 24% reduction from 2000 to 2013. Changes in recess and leisure time habits, such as smartphone use, may have influenced the result.",

    "Mean aesthetic scores were higher in the ADM-assisted breast reconstruction cohort including the total aesthetic score which was statistically significant. Aesthetic outcome alone may justify the added expense of incorporating biologic mesh. Moreover, ADM has other benefits which may render it cost-effective. Larger prospective studies are needed to provide plastic surgeons with more definitive guidelines for ADM use.",
    "Values for health states when ascribed to adults are higher than when those same states are associated with children. Were EQ-5D-3L values for adults applied to EQ-5D-Y health states, then this would effectively lead to an misrepresentation of the value assigned to a health status in children.",
    "Bearing in mind that the differences established in the parameters describing the cohorts, although statistically relevant, are of smaller clinical relevance, we regard as an important finding that the choice of therapy is in accordance with the basic knowledge about the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and possibilities of an individually chosen targeted intervention with antidiabetic therapy. We may conclude that most of the physicians participating in the PROROK project choose their therapy in a rational manner.",
    "Our data shows that miR-21, miR-192 and miR-200 could be used as new diagnostic markers for pancreatic cancer. A dynamics of these miRNAs could serve as a prognostic marker in patients after cancer removal. Futher prospective studies with newly-onset diabetic patients with no signs of malignancy will be needed to validate if suggested miRNAs could be used as early markers as well.",
    "It is incumbent upon the Gaelic Athletic Association to expand current safety regulations to eliminate injuries in these key areas. This should include mandatory checks of faceguards by match officials prior to the commencement of matches. Finally, there needs to be more robust data collection by the association to ascertain the true extent of long-term ocular morbidity following these types of injuries.",
    "External rotation immobilization after reduction of primary anterior shoulder dislocation could result in a decrease in anterior capsule detachment and labral reduction.",
    "Exercise is important for all subjects in terms of body development, growth, and oxygenization and to decrease cardiovascular risk factors. For the development of the ideal body anthropometric rates, obesity prevention, and for the growth of healthy generations, governments should give importance to sports and take incentive measures to increase children and young people's interest in the sport.",
    "Assessment timing has no effect on patient response to the perception of feeling a medication working right away. Differences found in satisfaction levels reported with weekly versus daily recall were consistent across treatment groups, indicating that no bias was introduced in favor of either treatment group. Patients characterized the perception of feeling a maintenance therapy working right away as easier breathing and reported this perception as beneficial to patient self-care.",
    "Patients with STEMI treated with PPCI who remained in Killip class I after the procedure and receive optimal pharmacological treatment have an excellent prognosis. All of them can probably be admitted safely to a step-down unit. Wide application of this management strategy may result in substantial cost savings.",
    "The prevalence of some form of anatomical failure, as determined by an increase in the interclip distance, is high at 6 months' postoperatively following LARS. However, this does not seem to correlate with a subjective recurrence of symptoms.",
    "In the absence of any clinical contra-indications and subject to availability of an interventional radiologist's support, one-stage antegrade stenting could easily be adopted as a routine approach for the management of benign or malignant ureteric obstruction.",
    "These results question the advantages of early brain plasticity, demonstrating poorer outcome from very early insults, and increasingly better function with lesions later in childhood.",
    "Eligibility varied substantially depending on the sizing criterion. In clinical practice both under- and oversizing were common. Industry guidelines should recognize the oval shape of the aortic annulus.",
    "Based on the idea of a continuum between temperament and affective disorders, the results should trigger further research on this issue possibly leading to novel treatment options in the future.",
    "Nearly half the patients with TB in London in 2003-4 were not offered HIV testing. In those offered testing, uptake was high. Patients in higher risk groups were more likely to be offered testing but, even within the highest risk groups, testing was not universally offered. This represents a missed opportunity for diagnosing HIV in patients with TB in London.",
    "The risk of developing COPD is still strongly associated with adult height. This association is strongest in the youngest age category, suggesting that early life experience will remain an important risk factor for COPD for some time to come and possibly that COPD related to early life deprivation is more severe and tends to present at a younger age.",
    "To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate preoperative predictors for surgical success in patients undergoing sphincterotomy. Although urodynamic evaluation is strongly advised prior to surgery in patients with spinal cord lesions, it improves prediction of success only marginally.",
    ": Despite being an older population, elderly patients with odontoid fracture who were managed non-OP had similar mortality, UTI, and pneumonia rates compared with their younger counterparts who underwent OP. The need for tracheostomy and PEG and discharge disposition was similar among all three groups. Elderly patients with odontoid fracture managed non-OP had a reduction in HLOS and ventilator days compared with either operative group and less DVT compared with the early operative group. Based on these results, non-OP management should be given strong consideration in elderly patients with traumatic odontoid fractures.",
    ": Late after polytrauma, women suffer more severe psychologic impairment than men who had similar injuries. This finding is independent of physical impairment and the subjective feeling of a good rehabilitation outcome. Clinically, women require special support even years after injury to improve their psychologic status. In the future, they might benefit from early concomitant psychologic treatment if mental problems are suspected.",
    "The Tower of London test and the Emotional Stability factor may require filtering of irrelevant information, activation of inhibition mechanisms, and use of negative feedback. The Alternating Fluency tasks and the Openness to Experience factor may require the ability to switch set and to express flexible thoughts or opinions in daily life. These results indicate that cognitive and personality changes in PD may be different expressions of a common psychologic mechanism related to the dysfunction of the frontostriatal system.",
    "The AzBF showed a sustained decrease of value after a bolus injection of 50-μg OCT. A further hemodynamic response is detectable at OCT readministration after 60 minutes. The pattern of hemodynamic response to OCT may not be uniform among cirrhotics.",
    "Although cross-sectional research cannot establish causal links, the results suggest that participation in club sport may enhance the health benefits of PA.",
    "For early adulthood, findings did not support commonplace or expert opinion that exercise behavior has a favorable influence on sleep. Rather, the findings lend support to the importance of cognitive processes in the onset and maintenance of sleep complaints.",
    "An elevated serum creatinine concentration at any time during the first 48 h of admission is not a marker for pancreatic necrosis in a first attack of acute pancreatitis. If serum creatinine is normal, necrotizing pancreatitis is unlikely, and contrast-enhanced CT need not be performed unless complications occur and/or the patient's condition deteriorates.",
    "Bowel US may be used as a surrogate of colonoscopy in assessing the short-term response of severe forms of UC to therapy. Both US score and endoscopic score after 3 months of steroid therapy predict outcome of disease at 15 months.",
    "The hospital-based group was better controlled with less frequent use of combination therapy. Our observations stress the necessity for regular review visits for children with moderately severe asthma especially in general practice.",
    "Scatter radiation dose from a single exposure as well as cumulative scatter dose from numerous exposures is significantly below natural background radiation. Infants in neighboring isolettes are not at added risk from radiation scatter as long as the isolettes are separated by at least 2 ft.",
    "SNNL is not always benign. The possible causes of this lesion include parasites and metastatic tumors. It is important to identify the minute foci of metastatic carcinoma for the appropriate management of this lesion.",
    "The pH value of wound solution proves to be a reliable predictor for the subsequent presence of seroma formation. Furthermore, our findings implicate that seroma formation cannot be seen as persistent drainage liquid.",
    "Patients of LSES were less likely to receive surgical extirpation, chemotherapy, or radiation and had significantly higher perioperative and long-term mortality rates. A greater understanding of the barriers to providing optimal care and identifying means for improving successful delivery of therapies to the poor with pancreatic cancer are needed.",
    "Endoscopic asymmetric inflammation of the pouch may represent an ischemia-associated pouchitis with characteristic clinical, radiographic, and histologic features. Its hemodynamic, cellular, and molecular basis of mechanism warrants further study.",
    "The omitting of N2O from anaesthetic regimen has a substantial impact on patient comfort after surgery by reducing incidence of PONV and it does not have any justifiable indication of its use in General anaesthesia.",
    "The habit of self ear cleaning should be discouraged as it is slow otologic poison with an attendant long term effect.",
    "In cardiac surgeons' outcomes quality monitoring, individual managed care plans face a \"law of small numbers.\" Insufficient patient volume by contracted surgeons, inadequate variation in outcomes, and low levels of adverse outcomes combine to make true quality almost impossible to infer. Some mitigation may be possible through more effective use of data (more measures and pooling over time) and through more effective interorganizational sharing of data (leveraging specialist society quality data and statewide pooling).",
    "Latino parents of overweight children did not differ from parents of nonoverweight children with respect to their KAB about childhood obesity.",
    "Adults commonly reported experiencing bullying while at school and these reports were associated with lower health-related quality of life in adulthood. School bullying needs further investigation as a preventable cause of mental health problems across the lifespan.",
    "The present findings suggest that gynecological status is associated with subjective sleep quality and objective sleep parameters in women with sleep complaints.",
    "In this pilot study, insulin resistance was the most prominent feature characterising NAFLD complicating PCOS. Total testosterone, FAI, DHEAS and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels were similar between patients with PCOS and without NAFLD.",
    "These results imply that initial fracture of the pin itself is unlikely; however, failure of the supporting bone or a decrease in pin strength due to biodegradation could account for early loss of the fixation.",
    "Patients with amblyopia and strabismus could see better with only one eye instead of both eyes. This could be related to inhibition of the binocular function of the brain by the misaligned amblyopic eye.",
    "A one-time, advanced diabetes education programme teaching intensive insulin self-management with an empowerment style can lead to sustained improvement in patient outcomes and reduce use of hospital services for people with Type 2 diabetes on insulin.",
    "A national emergency, September 11, 2001, inspired people to donate blood for the first time. However, the proportion of return donations amongst them was not increased. Females and males in certain age groups were more likely to become repeat donors due to the residual effect of September 11, 2001. Additional efforts are needed to retain eligible FTD in donor pools.",
    "True oncocytic neoplasms can be distinguished from mitochondrion-rich non-oncocytic tumours based on aberrant distribution of all major cell organelles. This distinction has immediate clinical relevance and should be implemented in practice.",
    "RBC biochemical and physical alterations during storage minimally affected the RBC ability to aggregate and deform, even after prolonged storage. The rheologic properties of leukoreduced RBC units were well preserved during 7 weeks of routine blood bank storage.",
    "Billroth II method of anastomosis was associated with higher rate of early postoperative complications. Therefore, we conclude that the Billroth I method should be the first choice after a distal gastrectomy as long as the anatomic and oncological environment of an individual patient allows us to perform it. However more prospective studies should be designed to compare the overall surgical outcomes of both anastomosis methods.",
    "While most TR-proteins have originated from prediction tools and are still awaiting experimental validations, supportive evidence exists for hundreds of TR-units in Nematostella. The existence of TR-proteins in early metazoan life may have served as a robust mode for novel genes with previously overlooked structural and functional characteristics.",
    "This work reinforces the importance of routine medication reviews, especially in residents exposed to polypharmacy regimens that include antiarrhythmics or antiparkinson drugs, in order to reduce the risk of fall-related injuries during nursing home stays.",
    "These data suggest that cirrhotic patients with PHC may progress towards PC, which, in turn, may be the cause for life-threatening sepsis.",
    "We found interesting differences in clinical and organisational performance between GPs with and without medical experience in developing countries and between their practices. It is not possible to attribute these differences to this experience, because the choice for medical experience in a tropical country probably reflects individual differences in professional motivation and personality. Experience in a developing country may be just as valuable for later performance in general practice as experience at home.",
    "It would appear that only angiomatous antrochoanal polyps present with epistaxis. Detection of the characteristic gross appearance of these polyps may help avoid unwanted surgery. Histopathological analysis confirms the diagnosis. A significantly increased number of plasma cells may be the underlying cause of the histological changes seen in angiomatous antrochoanal polyps.",
    "Apathy increases with age in otherwise healthy community-dwelling individuals, particularly in men.",
    "Current management protocols place moderately differentiated T1 penile squamous carcinoma without vascular invasion in a low risk category for metastatic disease. As such, expectant management is currently offered as a primary option for these patients. Our experience suggests that patients in this category are in fact at higher risk for metastatic disease, and may be offered early groin dissection in place of expectant management.",
    "Abnormalities in astrocyte cytoskeletal proteins are characteristic features for ALS, both in acquired and congenital forms of the disease. The cytoskeletal aberrations may lead to astroglial dysfunction and disturbances in glutamate uptake that may in turn increase the degeneration of motoneurons.",
    "Quality was consistent across co-ops in terms of service provision. Therefore the next step is to consider whether quality within the treatment received varies. Nevertheless, the result provides some support for using OOH co-ops as a means to provide OOH primary care.",
    "Evaluating the presence of this phenomenon in the different practice settings is recommended, to improve patient satisfaction and subsequently the quality of care.",
    "Chemoradiation therapy of esophageal adenocarcinoma does not eliminate tumor-associated BE, nor does it affect the length of the BE segment.",
    "Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty were equally effective at restoring mechanical function to an injured spine. Only kyphoplasty was able to reverse minor vertebral wedging.",
    "In patients treated with 3D-CRT for esophageal SCC, the omission of elective nodal irradiation was not associated with a significant amount of failure in lymph node regions not included in the planning target volume. Local failure and distant metastases remained the predominant problems.",
    "Effects of normal aging such as loss of PCC co-activity could be detected by ICA, but not by signal time course correlation analyses of DMN inter-connectivity. This either indicates lower sensitivity of inter-connectivity measures to detect subtle DMN changes or indicate that ICA and time course analyses determine different properties of DMN co-activation. Our results, therefore, provide fundamental knowledge for a potential future use of functional MRI as biomarker for neurodegenerative dementias where diminished DMN activity needs to be reliably differentiated from that observed in health aging.",
    "A significant proportion of drug-related visits are not deemed medication related by emergency physicians. Drug-related visits not attributed to medication-related problems by emergency physicians may be missed in ongoing outpatient adverse drug event surveillance programs intended to develop strategies to enhance drug safety. Further research is needed to determine what the effect may be of not attributing adverse drug events to medication-related problems.",
    "Chiropractic users are less likely to get flu shots, perhaps reflecting their national body's attitude, which could affect morbidity and mortality. Providers should be aware of their patients' CAM use and encourage accepted primary care practices.",
    "The survey reveals that the modern surgical trainee is gaining a low and inconsistent level of exposure to day case surgery despite being aware of the importance of this modality of training. An urgent review is required to ensure trainees become actively involved in day case surgery and are not missing on this vital training opportunity.",
    "Our results demonstrate that inflammatory mesenteric diseases are heterogeneous: high components of plasma cells, eosinophils and TCD8+ lymphocytes were found respectively in 46, 23 and 80 % of cases; eosinophils were observed exclusively in sclerotic forms. Only 31 % of cases encompass numerous IgG4+ plasma cells, suggesting a pathogenesis different than hyper-IgG4 diseases.",
    "Long-term survival and quality of life after nonelective cardiac surgery can equal that of the general elderly population. Age alone should not disqualify a patient for urgent or emergent cardiac surgery.",
    "The extension of medical treatment in our population to 74 % of all EUP yielded a high success rate, 83 %.",
    "Even among highly trained mental health professionals, exposure to these two commonly used terms evokes systematically different judgments. The commonly used \"substance abuser\" term may perpetuate stigmatizing attitudes.",
    "These results suggest that MF and AA GCLs represent a similar, if not the same, disease. Comparing the aggressive and nonaggressive subgroups, more similarities were found than when evaluating without stratification by clinical behavior. The remaining differences could be explained by the likelihood that MF tumors are diagnosed earlier than AA tumors because of facial exposure and dental screening examinations and radiographs.",
    "Our data suggest that hypertonic saline does not affect platelet P selectin expression or platelet-leukocyte aggregation at therapeutic plasma concentrations but that an inhibitory effect occurs at supratherapeutic doses. Dilutions of other solutions caused the least disturbance of platelet activation.",
    "Reformatting of CCT and APCT scans gives improved sensitivity in the detection of thoracic and lumbar spine fractures in trauma patients. Future study looking at clinically significant fractures or those that change clinical management decisions may find that the reformatted images are not routinely needed as a screening tool.",
    "The practice of allowing residents who have undergone treatment for substance abuse to return to their training program in clinical anesthesia remains highly controversial. They are often lost to follow-up, making it difficult, if not impossible to determine if re-training in a different medical specialty decreases their risk for relapse. A comprehensive assessment of the outcomes associated with alternatives to re-entry into clinical anesthesia training programs is needed.",
    "Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.",
    "Movement observation is accompanied by changes in the beta oscillatory activity of the STN, similar to those observed in the EEG.",
    "The findings suggest that ERM may be associated with sub-ILM changes that alter the plane of separation during ILM peeling. This study does not confirm any influence of dyes on the cleavage plane during surgery.",
    "The incidence of Mallampati classes 3 and 4 increases during labour compared with the pre-labour period, and these changes are not fully reversed by 48 h after delivery. This work confirms the absolute necessity of examining the airway before anaesthetic management in obstetric patients.",
    "These findings show that incident IFG, IGT, and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes are associated with reduced HRF independent of cardiovascular disease and that this is evident before the onset of these conditions. If future health promotion campaigns are to effectively target those at high risk of developing diabetes, an understanding of the process of declining health before onset of the disease is essential.",
    "Cognitive training that targets reasoning and speed of processing can improve the cognitive-specific sense of personal control over one's life in older adults.",
    "Simple models based on age and BMD alone or age and fracture history alone predicted 10-year risk of hip, major osteoporotic, and clinical fracture as well as more complex FRAX models.",
    "This study indicates that PRL induces apoptosis in the androgen-responsive cell line LNCaP, whereas no effect was observed in the androgen-insensitive PC3 cell line. These findings suggest that androgen responsiveness may be required for PRL to be effective on prostatic cells.",
    "In this study, an early reamed intramedullary nailing fixation procedure resulted in more adverse effects on system stress, inflammatory response, and multiple organs. The injuries also cause histologic damages to lungs and liver. Therefore, early reamed intramedullary nailing fixation may pose a potential risk of developing complications and adopting the DCO strategy may be more preferable. Shock and IM combined cause most severe damages, followed by IM without shock, shock plus EF, and shock plus conservative procedure in that order. If IM must be used for some reasons, it is desirable be delayed until shock has been fully controlled and vasculorespiratory stability restored.",
    "Black patients appear to receive lower quality and higher intensity of care in crude analyses. However, these differences were explained by different case-mix and variation in care across hospitals. Within the same hospital, no racial differences in care were observed.",
    "The ARR did not predict the blood pressure response to SPIRO. SPIRO 50 mg was significantly more effective than BFZ 2.5 mg in lowering SABP irrespective of baseline ARR, plasma renin activity or aldosterone.",
    "The small lymph nodes in the hilar or mediastinal stations frequently had metastases of carcinoma even though largest and second largest lymph nodes were negative for metastases, especially in adenocarcinoma cases. Surgical oncologists should, therefore, perform systemic lymph node dissection, and not sampling, during a pulmonary resection of lung cancer.",
    "In the setting of capsular contracture, physical examination with or without mammogram is as accurate as magnetic resonance imaging in determining implant integrity. Although magnetic resonance imaging is a sensitive diagnostic tool, in symptomatic patients with capsular contracture, it cannot be viewed as infallible.",
    "There has been a significant increase in the percentage of colorectal cancer patients older than age 75 years. Failing to screen patients younger than 50 years and older than the age of 75 years would miss 49% of patients treated at our institution from 2003 to 2007.",
    "Dental therapists feel that they are part of the clinical team but consider that their skills are not fully utilised in many cases. There is scope for raising awareness among dentists regarding the therapists' clinical potential as well as sharing ideas for good working practice both within individual clinical settings and between different practices.",
    "Peyer's patch can be indicated as an anatomical repair landmark, and there is a need to study the healing of colorectal anastomoses in rats based on differing quantities of tissue collagen existing in the colonic wall with or without this structure.",
    "We did not observe an association between the use of ACE inhibitors and hypotension during anesthesia. The authors considered that the recommendation to discontinue ACE inhibitors on the day before the surgery should be reviewed. Other studies are necessary to confirm those results.",
    "The PAB can be performed with acceptable mortality rates compatible with the ones of the world literature. Nevertheless, the adjustment of the banding is difficult to be assessed during the surgery by making the procedure complex and justifying the high incidence of complications and long stay in ICU. It wasn't found any specific risk factor significant to mortality neither uni- or biventricular heart disease.",
    "Aprotinin quantitatively preserved the blood platelets in children with acyanogenic congenital heart disease.",
    "As the surgical treatment of DDH involves complex osteotomies around the hip and these surgeries have effect on long term outcome, MRI evaluation of femoral anteversion as a part of pre operative evaluation is advised. Also, as the intra operative evaluation needs enough clinical experience and it can not be performed in cases requiring femoral shortening for reduction, we consider pre operative evaluation of femoral anteversion by MRI as essential rather than adjunctive.",
    "Tailoring antireflux surgery according to esophageal motility is not indicated. At present, the relevant factor for selection of a Nissen or Toupet fundoplication is personal experience. Anterior fundoplication offers less effective long-term reflux control.",
    "Our results indicate that immediate surgery for patients with cT3N0 rectal cancer represents an undertreatment risk in at least 28% of cases, making necessary the use of postoperative chemoradiotherapy. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy should be the therapy of choice on the grounds of the principle that overtreatment is less hazardous than undertreatment for cT3N0 rectal cancers.",
    "The role of DS was effective to improve symptom relief but was poor in terms of morbidity and mortality control. So, ethical concerns have to be addressed, and medical treatment or stenting for left-side obstructions only should be considered as alternative procedures.",
    "Quality of life assessment instruments based on urban-living arrangements may not be reliably used with individuals living in rural environments.",
    "T2 measurements were increased in medial knee OA patients with varus alignment, adding support to the theory of an association of OA and joint alignment.",
    "This explorative study detected a high variability of knot tying techniques among German surgeons. In the absence of any evidence of the superiority of one particular technique, continuing education should focus on the quality of each single knot and perfect the details of the technique used.",
    "Latino expectant fathers seem aware that their smoking could harm the pregnancy but seem less concerned about the effect of their diet and exercise on the pregnancy. Pregnancy may be a time to help Latino expectant fathers quit smoking.",
    "BDSR can be justified as an alternative radical operation for patients with middle bile duct in selected patients with no adjacent organ invasion and resection margin is negative.",
    "Healthcare facilities must be prepared to cope with staffing shortages in the event of a disaster and volunteers such as retired physicians could fill crucial roles in a medical response plan. The majority of retired physicians surveyed would be willing to participate. They would be most willing to perform well-defined tasks directly related to patient care. Most would be willing to participate in preparatory training.",
    "An accurate history might improve accuracy for some cytologists.",
    "Despite concerns over CAM efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness, use of CAM is popular among patients attending an ENT clinic. Their use is not generally related to their presenting illness. Otolaryngologists should be aware of current trends in CAM use when managing patients, including possible interactions with other medication.",
    "Women with PCOS have elevated levels of sex steroid precursors, estrogens, androgens, and glucuronidated androgen metabolites as measured with a specific and sensitive mass spectrometry-based technique. The combination of elevated estrone (>50 pg/ml) and free testosterone (>3.3 pg/ml) appeared to discriminate with high sensitivity and specificity between women with and without PCOS.",
    "Training metacognitive skills, such as self-testing and efficient study allocation, can improve the ability to learn new information in healthy older adults. More importantly, older adult clients can be supplied with an at-home training manual, which will ease the burden on practitioners.",
    "A rapid decrease in angiogenic stimulating factors occurs in the subacute phase of AMI and is related to a progressive decrease in myocardial contraction. A negative consequence of such a circuit is a successive reduction in the vascular supply and contractility in areas with reduced perfusion. These negative adaptations can be counteracted by angiogen overexpression.",
    "In the diagnosis of recurrent disease in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma and low Tg level, the sensitivity of rhTSH-stimulated PET/CT-FDG seems to be low and no correlation was observed between PET/CT-FDG findings and Tg level. However, positive PET-FDG results have been found in 9/44 (20%) patients with serum Tg levels lower than 10 microg/L. Therefore, this series shows that a cutoff value of 10 microg/L for the Tg under T(4) is probably not the best criteria to select patient candidates for PET/CT-FDG examination to detect the recurrence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma.",
    "TAE of the gastroduodenal artery appears to be a safe alternative when endoscopic therapy for bleeding duodenal ulcer fails, at least in high-risk patients. The role of TAE in low-risk patients with bleeding from duodenal ulcer needs to be defined by means of a prospective controlled trial.",
    "Analysis of a large series of cardiac surgical patients demonstrates significant reduction in deep sternal wound infection incidence in 15 years. Introduction of perioperative intravenous insulin may explain some observed risk reduction. Efforts should focus on prevention, because mortality remains elevated.",
    "Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy has its greatest benefit in patients receiving brachytherapy who have a large prostate and an International Prostate Symptom Score of 15 or greater.",
    "Nephroureterectomy with BCE remains the standard of care in the treatment of UC of the renal pelvis and should invariably be performed in patients with locally advanced disease. Conversely, patients with pT1 and pT2 disease could be considered for NU without compromising CSM. However, recurrence data are needed to fully confirm the validity of this option.",
    "Non-endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography- and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography-induced pancreatitis did not differ as regards severity, hospital stay or mortality; in mild pancreatitis, serum amylase halved significantly sooner in post-endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography cases.",
    "There is an interest in evaluating standard practice in parenteral nutrition in order to develop improvement strategies. Infants and toddlers are the principal candidates for parenteral nutrition. Standardisation is one way to decrease errors in its preparation and prescription.",
    "Therapeutic levels of neither dobutamine nor levosimendan showed inotropic oxygen wasting in this in vivo pig model. Thus, relevant hemodynamic responses can be achieved with an adrenergic inotrope without surplus oxygen consumption.",
    "Self-report and consultation data provide comparable estimates of the prevalence of specific diagnoses such as diabetes. For other conditions, self-report and consultation records provide different measures of prevalence, and the choice of measure will depend on the morbidity being studied.",
    "Because an erythropoietic response is seen in half of patients and even one third of those with iron-replete stores responded whereas peripheral indices had only a moderate utility in predicting response, the therapeutic trial to intravenous iron seems to be a useful tool in the management of anemia in nondialysis patients with CKD.",
    "Our results demonstrate that the cut-off values for WC that would best predict cardiometabolic risk associated with insulin resistance are 93 cm for men and 83 cm for women in Turkish adults. However, our findings also raise the question as to whether it is indeed necessary to define a WC cut-off value for the prediction of insulin resistance, because, regardless of the cut-off WC value taken into account, insulin resistance will be overlooked in a significant number of individuals with a WC below this cut-off value.",
    "Decreases in concentration of lipophilic chemicals on a lipid-adjusted basis during lactation should no longer be assumed. Thus, the concept of pumping and discarding early milk as means of reducing infant exposure is not supported. The hypothesis that persistent lipophilic chemicals, on a lipid-adjusted basis, have consistent concentrations across matrices is likely too simplistic.",
    "A clear significant association between actual survival and the physicians' estimates, but not the patients' estimates, was observed. If agreement regarding the prognosis exists, the relationship between physicians' and patients' estimates is probably non-linear. Assessing one's chances of being cured is a highly emotional task, and psychological processes such as denial or repression most likely play a decisive role. Moreover, collusion between the patient and physician may be inevitable in this situation. Whether it is desirable to gain concordance and who will benefit from such efforts must be discussed and empirically studied.",
    "Feedback based on videotaped interviews is superior to the feedback given solely based on the observation of assessors.",
    "Future research should explore the possibility of a subtype of psychotic depression that is associated with PTSD, resulting in a poorer course of illness. The current findings highlight the need for pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic approaches that can be better tailored to psychotic MDD patients with PTSD comorbidity.",
    "These results indicate that studies on familial breast or prostate cancer risk which do not take the relative's diagnosis date into account are applicable to screening and clinical counselling situations. The estimates according to the register-based definition are based on larger numbers of patients, which may be crucial for analysis of small groups such as families of multiple cases.",
    "Mucinous cystadenoma recurrence is apparently not as rare as reported in the literature. Intraoperative cyst rupture and cystectomy instead of adnexectomy emerged as being two risk factors for recurrence.",
    "A validated technique for predicting utilization subsequent to a price increase would be highly useful for program managers. Our individual and aggregate-level results cast doubt on the usefulness of WTP surveys for this purpose.",
    "Strength training may improve walking function and alignment in some patients for whom weakness is a major contributor to their gait deficits. However, in other patients, it may produce no change or even undesired outcomes. Given the variability of outcomes in this and other strengthening studies in CP, analytical approaches to determine the sources of variability are needed to better identify those individuals who are most likely to benefit from strengthening.",
    "Male sex and smoking decrease the protective effects of the N allele. The adverse effects of the K allele on the CAD risk resulting from the K167N polymorphism appear to be independent of other cardiovascular risk factors.",
    "The unfavorable outcome of two cases is a rare example of failure of percutaneous therapy of ALA. Mortality is a possible event even in a non-endemic area such as Italy. More observational data are needed to confirm the possibility of a new epidemiological trend.",
    "This qualitative study shows that generally, patients and professionals perceived the multidisciplinary outpatient care programme as applicable and effective. After incorporating improvement suggestions this program seems promising for further, broader application and hypothesis testing. For those, negatively evaluating the programme, alternatives should be explored.",

    "Clinically important (i.e., requiring therapeutic intervention) postoperative myocardial infarction was detected by ECG changes. The benefit of determining changes in CK-MB was minimal from a therapeutic perspective.",
    "Adherence to practice guidelines can and does occur in an open access system. Specialists request endoscopy more frequently for appropriate indications compared to nonspecialists and have a higher yield of information relevant to patient care. Further refinement and better definition of some indications within the AUGE are needed to increase the clinical utility of this document.",
    "A significant increase in the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux occurred within 3 months after surgery in both study groups. Despite the less invasive nature of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the type of surgery did not influence the degree of esophageal dysfunction.",
    "Patients without acute vomiting or moderate-severe acute nausea may not need any antiemetic prophylaxis for delayed vomiting or nausea, while those with a history of acute vomiting or moderate-severe acute nausea should always be treated for delayed emesis. Selection bias and dependence effect of delayed emesis on acute emesis can cause misinterpretation of data derived from clinical trials in patients submitted to multiple cycles of chemotherapy.",

    "Our data show that the prevalence of smoking after heart transplantation may be relatively high, especially in former smokers. Repeated measurements of CO-Hb could be helpful in its detection. Despite a relatively low cigarette count, smoking is a major risk factor of morbidity and mortality after heart transplantation (HTx). Approximately 4 years of exposure time is needed to uncover its negative influence. These findings should lead to aggressive smoking screening and weaning programs in every HTx center.",
    "The bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt is a suboptimal stimulus for pulmonary artery enlargement, but may reduce the risk of Fontan operation in selected children. Fenestrated lateral tunnel operations have reduced the duration of postoperative pleural effusions.",
    "We found no significant differences between trials in maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), peak or progression of Borg Scale (RPE), maximum systolic and diastolic BPs, peak pulse, or t",
    "Human umbilical cord, with its comparable diagnostic efficiency, could replace monkey tissues, with the advantages of saving both money and monkeys. Moreover, it seems the most suitable substrate in the follow-up, as it enables detection of non-compliant patients with persisting mucosal alterations.",
    "The detection of IgM anti-measles virus in the majority of patients with Crohn's disease and in about half of ulcerative colitis patients as compared to a very low prevalence in patients with other chronic inflammatory disease is consistent with the hypothesis that the measles virus has pathogenetic implications in inflammatory bowel diseases.",
    "Gallbladder motility in patients with systemic sclerosis is preserved in response to both cholinergic and hormonal stimulation, even when other gastrointestinal motor disturbances are present. These results suggest that patients with systemic sclerosis are not at increased risk for cholelithiasis because of gallbladder dysmotility.",
    "RPL is a heterogeneous pancreatic disease including juvenile and senile presentation which may represent about 15% of pancreatic lithiasis. Evolution towards calcified stages (PRS then TC then ECS) occurred in 37-50% of cases and could be related to a genetic factor and increased alcohol consumption.",
    "Selective neck dissection does not compromise survival and may minimize surgical morbidity in the N0/Np+ population.",
    "Recent increases in work RVUs for many gynecologic procedures have resulted in improved reimbursement. However, even with these improvements, significant gender bias still exists in the Medicare reimbursement of female-specific procedures. This gender bias is further magnified as more private insurance carriers use the system to set reimbursement.",
    "Most adult asthmatics are under the care of FDs; however, these appear to under-treat to a considerable degree, especially respecting the use of inhaled corticosteroids. It must be emphasised strongly that Asthma is an inflammatory disease; and FDs must become better informed of the directives of the international consensus on asthma.",
    "The finding of organ-specific autoantibodies in coeliac patients discloses the coexistence of a wide spectrum of immunological diseases.",
    "A constant difference between measured and calculated VO2 can be detected in carefully controlled clinical conditions. The difference between the two methods is due to both lung oxygen consumption and errors in the measurement of VO2 thermodilution cardiac output, haemoglobin and blood oxygen contents. We suggest that the perioperative changes of the VO2-difference are due not only to variation of the measurements but also to changes in lung metabolic activity.",
    "Currently, few physicians discuss HIV testing with all their prenatal patients.",
    "Laparoscopic splenectomy can be performed safely in children. In our hospital, LS is more expensive than OS. The faster return to school and normal activity warrants the continued use of this procedure despite the increased cost.",
    "Reliable results can be obtained only when knowing the exact section thickness. In very thin sections the method of Bins leads to reliable results; in medium-thick sections the methods of McCready and Haraske result in correct ploidy values. Sections thicker than 7 microns do not need histogram correction.",
    "The primary discharge diagnosis often failed to reflect the reason for ICU admission, making it impossible to consistently establish the reason for ICU admission from the discharge data. The reason for ICU admission was also frequently not included among the secondary discharge diagnoses. Administrative data are therefore not useful for ICU quality management and other functions. Intensivists need to establish their own databases.",
    "There was no enduring improvement in the treatment of depression for primary care patients. Depression treatment guidelines were achieved contemporaneously, however, for intervention patients enrolled in a multifaceted program of collaborative care during the training period. These results suggest that continuing programs of reorganized service delivery to support the role of a primary care physician (eg, on-site mental health personnel, close monitoring of patient progress and adherence), in addition to physician training, are essential for the success of guideline implementation.",
    "Many patients did not understand their situation well enough to make a truly autonomous treatment decision, and their doctors often failed to recognize this.",
    "Although the authors' results with single application are encouraging, the use of mitomycin for pterygia remains controversial. The biologic potency of this agent, the duration of its action, and the dearth of large-scale controlled, randomized trials demand cautious individual judgment by the surgeon when considering the use of this potent drug.",
    "Paediatric subjects are able to donate the required units of blood as they have a good Epo response to mild anaemia. The amount of blood donated did not exceed their total mobilisable iron and the iron supplement was adequate for red cell synthesis.",
    "In both studies relative nocturnal therapy resistance to the antiproteinuric effect of RAS blockade was found, despite 24-h efficacy of blood pressure effect. This may have clinical relevance because it contributes to rest-proteinuria and thus may affect long term renal function outcome. It may be worthwhile to explore alternative therapeutic regimens to improve the nocturnal antiproteinuric response.",
    "Even experienced colorectal surgeons will misdiagnose up to one-fifth of patients presenting with fecal incontinence if assessment is based on the history and physical examination alone. However surgically correctable causes of incontinence are rarely missed on clinical assessment.",
    "In the era of aggressive medical management for ulcerative colitis with both steroids and cyclosporine, the complications of immunosuppression may be significant, including opportunistic pneumonia. Prophylaxis against P. carinii pneumonia with sulfa antibiotics should be considered, especially in patients for whom proctocolectomy is a potential end point.",
    "In a high-risk group of patients undergoing cardiac operations, infectious outcome could not be effectively influenced by an additional and prolonged postoperative prophylaxis regimen with low-dose vancomycin and ticarcillin/clavulanate. Low-dose vancomycin did not reduce the rate of infections or colonizations of intravascular catheters with gram-positive organisms.",
    "The diagnostic sensitivities of EUS and ERC are similar for extrahepatic cholestasis. ERC is first indicated in poor candidates for surgery, since endoscopic therapy is frequently required. In good candidates for surgery, EUS should be carried out first in order to stage a tumor or identify choledocholithiasis.",
    "Nutritional counselling is an effective means of treating bulimia nervosa, with improvement maintained up to 3 months follow-up. The addition of fluoxetine may confer some benefit during active treatment, but its discontinuation may contribute to a higher rate of recurrence of symptoms post treatment. Of course, this study cannot be extrapolated to the efficacy of fluoxetine when used as the only form of treatment in patients for whom intensive nutritional counselling or other structured psychological programs are not available.",
    "We conclude that the greater specificity of the antibody in the EMIT for the CSA parent compound does not translate into a clinically relevant advantage for CSA monitoring.",
    "Chiropractors demonstrated the personalized nature of their care by the specificity of their responses to each patient. The importance of explaining the adjustment and the sensations that patients are likely to experience, particularly in new patients, is confirmed. The desirability of scrutinizing the patient for evidence of stress and of using diverse strategies for minimizing the stress response are discussed. Although the chiropractic consultation is not generally regarded as a stress-provoking experience, chiropractors should actively screen their patients for evidence of stress and take steps to enhance their patients' perceptions of the chiropractic consultation as a stress-free experience.",
    "CT is well suitable to determine the stages of epiphyseal union of the medial clavicle. It may become a generally accepted method of age identification during adolescence and the 3rd decade of life. The presented data serve as a reference population at least for white Europeans.",
    "In diagnosis of foreign body injuries of the orbit, CT is the imaging method of choice.",
    "The size of scotomas depends on the surface topography of the tested area. The prominent nasal part of the optic disc appears less \"blind\" than the shallow temporal part, probably due to more intensive light scattering by the prominent nasal part of the disc.",
    "Results of our study show that a constellation of morphologic features suggest the diagnosis of PRCCCT rather than that of RM. Our study suggests that calcification is highly specific for the diagnosis of PRCCCT. However, percutaneous biopsy remains indicated to ascertain the diagnosis.",
    "Endoscopic release of the carpal tunnel is as effective as the open release but it gives less postoperative pain. Because of the risk of complications and the additional costs, the endoscopic release is not the preferred method for treatment of the carpal tunnel syndrome, however.",
    "These results suggest that the lag theory cannot fully explain the relationship between changing alcohol consumption and cirrhosis mortality and that other factors, such as alcoholism treatment rates, are involved in the wide geographical variability of the latency periods.",
    "Treatment with an antibiotic only regimen was effective for the healing of duodenal ulcer, and clearance as well as eradication of H pylori contributed significantly to the healing. The results constituted the strongest evidence to date that H pylori infection was aetiologically related to duodenal ulceration, and support the concept of treating duodenal ulcer associated with H pylori as an infection and relieving its symptoms with acid reducing agents such as antacids.",
    "Despite adequate and durable reflux control after fundoplication in patients with chronic GORD, no change was found in oesophageal motor function with time. The higher contraction amplitude and decreased frequency of failed primary peristalsis seen in patients having a total fundic wrap were thus most likely due to a mechanical outflow obstruction in the gastro-oesophageal junction. These results could therefore be interpreted in favour of the hypothesis that GORD is pathogenetically linked to a primary defect in oesophageal motor function.",
    "Our findings indicate that teleradiology has an important role in improving inter-hospital management of head-injured patients.",
    "Women whose main spoken language was not English were less likely to receive important preventive services. Improving communication with patients with limited English may enhance participation in screening programs.",
    "The intervention was associated with a substantial increase in laboratory workload, all of which was accounted for by increases in non-serious lesions. This observation should be taken into account when considering the merits of a policy requiring histological examination in every case.",
    "In hypertensives chronic treatment with NSAIDs or ACEI alone or in combination did not change RPF or GFR and did not change renal functional reserve capacity of RPF or GFR.",
    "This meta-analysis did not find any relationship between metronidazole exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy and birth defects.",
    "Clinical pathways significantly improve the length of stay and decrease inpatient charges for major vascular surgical procedures while maintaining high standards of care. Factors that favorably affected the length of stay and hospital charges were outpatient arteriography, same-day admission, early ambulation, physical therapy, home care, use of the intensive care unit on a selective basis, and early discharge. Factors that adversely affected these outcomes were emergency admission, inpatient arteriography, thrombolytic therapy, complications, and the need for dialysis or anticoagulation.",
    "This investigation demonstrated altered mechanical properties of the aneurysmal wall as well as in the CCA in individuals with AAAs. The normal age- and gender-related differences seen in the healthy aorta and CCA vanished. The results suggest that AAA is a generalized process of the vasculature with focal manifestation in the abdominal aorta.",
    "Multidisciplinary, accountable and audited clinical ethics committees with predominantly advisory, practice development and educational roles could provide a valuable contribution to UK clinical practice and perhaps in other countries that have not developed hospital clinical ethics committees.",
    "VLBW infants receive far fewer transfusions than the number previously reported. Assigning units to individual patients and holding those units for 30 days, together with efforts to minimize the need for transfusions make routine use of r-HuEPO unnecessary.",
    "The intradecidual sign does not appear to be sensitive or specific in diagnosis of an early intrauterine pregnancy. When an intrauterine fluid collection is present without an embryo or yolk sac (with positive pregnancy test results), a follow-up sonogram should be obtained unless contraindicated clinically.",
    "Early hospital admission of acute stroke is beneficial. An educational effort is needed to increase early hospital referral of acute stroke patients.",
    "In patients with recurrent symptoms after cholecystectomy and enzymatic cholestasis SOD was reliably diagnosed by ultrasonography (sensitivity: 85%, specificity: 100%), and this finding may guide endoscopic sphincterotomy.",
    "Despite strong evidence of its effectiveness, many patients with established CVD were not receiving aspirin. Daily aspirin treatment was less likely in men with less recent major CVD events and in those who had not received invasive treatment.",
    "Depending on the complexity of cases, quantity of disposable equipment used, and patient-insurance mix, therapeutic ERCP may be cost prohibitive for a given endoscopy unit. Indirect costs should be more carefully and quantitatively analyzed. Disposable equipment should be evaluated in terms of cost, safety, and patient outcome.",
    "The finding of telomerase activity in six of 16 biopsies from patients with BPH could indicate early prostate cancer and suggests that telomerase activity may be of use as a biomarker in patients diagnosed with BPH and who may subsequently develop prostate cancer.",
    "Nailfold capillaroscopy during cold exposure is able to discriminate between healthy persons and patients with primary Raynaud's syndrome, but seems to be of minor value for follow-up evaluation of patients because of intraindividual variations. Laser Doppler fluxmetry is invalid for both purposes when using the applied cold exposure test.",
    "This study suggests that large amounts of support to methadone-maintained clients are not cost-effective, but it also demonstrates that moderate amounts of support are better than minimal amounts. As funding for these programs is reduced, these findings suggest a floor below which supplementary support should not fall.",
    "Bifocals seemed to slow myopia progression in these children with near-point esophoria, although a longer-term study with more subjects is needed to confirm this finding. Myopia progressed more rapidly during the school year than during summer vacation.",
    "According to general standards, IC patients had a more healthy daily diet than the general population. The observation that IC patients consumed less coffee (caffeine) than the general population is consistent with previous reports on irritative IC symptoms exacerbating after caffeine consumption. No rationale for other dietary or fluid intake changes was found.",
    "Both proinsulin and C-peptide levels were significantly associated with the sympathovagal balance of autonomic nervous function in NIDDM patients and control subjects, but this study cannot determine whether these compounds are directly involved in autonomic nervous dysfunction.",
    "The vagal effect of ATP may identify the subgroup of patients at high risk of severe cardioinhibitory response of vagal origin who likely will benefit from pacemaker therapy. This fast, uncomplicated test should be considered for further use in screening patients with vasovagal syndrome.",
    "Brief intracoronary infusion of CaCl2 mimicked, whereas treatment with dimethylamiloride blocked, infarct size reduction with preconditioning, thereby implicating calcium as a mediator of preconditioning in this canine model.",
    "Improvements in communication of pertinent information must be implemented in managed care systems such as TennCare to better inform participants of the proper use of the system. MCOs will not reduce inappropriate use of the ED if patients are not aware of their responsibilities and do not know their PCPs or how to gain access to them. PCP responsiveness to patients must also be improved.",
    "We conclude that patients with type B dissection have a steeper postoperative death hazard as compared to type A dissection patients. Age confounding or late entry do not explain the difference. This could be possibly related to a greater propensity for expansion, higher risk of malperfusion complications or to limitations of our current surgical treatment.",
    "Video-assisted thoracoscopy appears to have a complementary role in staging NSCLC when other methods are equivocal. It has the potential for increased sensitivity over conventional staging methods.",
    "This study did not show longer waiting time to be a significant predictor of relapse in early larynx cancer. Other end-points which are relevant, such as quality of life, have not been examined. Longer treatment times were significantly associated with relapse.",
    "These data support the theory that sustained endothelial dysfunction is involved in the molecular pathogenesis of radiation enteropathy, and point to TM as important in the chronic nature of radiation enteropathy and a potential target for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions.",
    "Compared to analogous techniques there is no loss of image information when employing digital selenium radiography in chest x-rays. On the contrary, new assessment criteria may be gained. We conclude that digital selenium radiography offers diagnostic advantages in chest x-ray examination.",
    "Army and civilian residencies prepare family physicians for the medical aspects of practice. Early training in management subjects could be enhanced. Civilian and Army programs could improve training in family medicine subjects.",
    "It was concluded that the surgical sequence of applying cryotherapy before drainage of SRF can be safely and effectively performed. The sequences CDAE and CDE, when air injection is not required, along with DACE should all be part of the surgical repertoire for the management of retinal detachments.",
    "Abnormal BRS may be reflected in the heart by global prolongation of ventricular repolarisation, but not by dispersion of ventricular repolarisation. This may, in part, explain the increase in sudden cardiac death seen in IDDM patients.",
    "Increased first-trimester CD63 expression is an independent risk factor for development of preeclampsia. CD63 expression might be useful to identify a subgroup of patients with a high risk for development of preeclampsia, especially in combination with first-trimester antenatal diastolic blood pressure. This method of patient selection may enable more efficient intervention studies in patients at risk than do the selection methods used so far.",
    "DR or ER after recanalization within 2 hours after tPA bolus was sustained at 3 months in most patients (75%) in our study. Complete or partial early recanalization leads to better outcome at 3 months after stroke. Fewer patients achieve good long-term outcome without early recanalization.",
    "Among patients with MI in a large unselected cohort in a French region, the one-year mortality was significantly lower in those referred for angiography. However, after correction for the confounding effects of simple baseline clinical indicators of risk, this apparent benefit reflected the fact that angiography was performed in those at lowest risk.",
    "In a Swedish university hospital with a high volume of coronary angioplasty procedures, we found no significant difference in mortality between patients who had thrombolysis and those who underwent acute coronary angiography. However, requirement of revascularization and symptoms of angina pectoris 1 year later was considerably less frequent in those who had undergone acute coronary angiography. However, distribution of baseline characteristics was skewed and efforts should be focused on the selection of patients for the different reperfusion strategies.",
    "Pre- and postoperative treatment for at least 4 days with metronidazole rectally reduces significantly vaginal cuff infection among women with abnormal vaginal flora.",
    "Varicella vaccination during early pregnancy may be a cause of miliary fetal tissue calcifications and fetal hydrops.",
    "As females aged and self-reported health status comparisons declined, their depressive symptoms increased steadily, but at a lower rate than males' depressive symptoms. Older persons in fair or poor self-reported health should especially be screened for increasing depressive symptoms. Although females generally report greater risk of high depressive symptoms, it is still a concern for males as they age and their health declines.",
    "Endoscopic polypectomy is a safe and effective method of treating large colorectal polyps.",
    "Four independent risk factors of yeast isolation in the peritoneal fluid were identified in critically ill surgical patients with peritonitis. The presence of at least three of these factors (grade C score) was associated with a high rate of yeast detection. This approach could be helpful to initiate early antifungal therapy in this patient population.",
    "Transatrial or transventricular inspection to peripatch areas in the beating heart is a safe technique to detect a residual shunt, an observation that may eliminate reoperation.",
    "In patients with stage II (N1) NSCLC, only in case of station 10 involved, pneumonectomy could allow a better survival lowering the incidence of local recurrence. However the major part of patients with stage II (N1) NSCLC die for distant metastasis. This supports the necessity to develop a specific systemic treatment.",
    "Khalas dates, when eaten alone or in mixed meals with plain yoghurt have low glycaemic indexes. The consumption of dates may be of benefit in glycaemic and lipid control of diabetic patients. The consumption of dates in mixed meals with yoghurt appears to have, at most, a minimal effect on the glycaemic index.",
    "The inhibitory interference of low radiation doses with the iNOS pathway in inflammatory macrophages appears to be based on radiation effects on the translational and posttranslational control mechanisms of iNOS activity. However, contrary to our working hypothesis this is not related to radiation-induced induction of HO-1 expression and thereby increased degradation of heme which is essential for iNOS activity. Thus, other posttranslational modifications such as the proteasome degradation pathway might be involved.",
    "Cholangioscopy after successful endoscopic or percutaneous therapy of complicated choledocholithiasis seems to be useful, because in bile ducts radiographically free of stones, cholangioscopy detects stone fragments in some patients. Further studies are needed to demonstrate if cholangioscopy can reduce the rate of symptomatic relapse after treatment of complicated choledocholithiasis.",
    "A remarkably high proportion of ovarian carcinoma survivors suffered from fatigue. Because this symptom is a key predictor of QOL, it should be given more attention in aftercare programs.",
    "Sociodemographic profile, anxiety, and maternal personality profile are related to overuse of pediatric services. Compulsive, schizoid and dependent personality disorders seem to be associated with overuse.",
    "The clinical results of this study suggest that laparoscopic myomectomy for intramural fibroids penetrating the uterine cavity is a safe procedure, providing well known advantages of minimal access surgery.",
    "Several potentially modifiable lifestyle factors are associated with urinary incontinence. Highest odds ratios were found for body mass index, heavy smoking and tea drinking.",
    "Apart from the merits of regular audit exercise and increasing experience of the staff, the Hawthorne effect might be the major contributing factor in the reduction of birth trauma and birth asphyxia related to instrumental deliveries during the study period.",
    "Lifestyle risk factors associated with child-rearing lead to obesity and result in increased CHD in both sexes; biological responses of pregnancy may have additional adverse effects in women.",
    "Most collecting duct carcinomas are already metastatic at presentation. Because the prognosis is dismal despite radical nephrectomy, biopsy should be performed first when radiological findings are suggestive of collecting duct carcinoma. For metastatic collecting duct carcinoma radical nephrectomy alone does not seem to be useful except for palliative reasons or in the framework of new multicentric chemotherapy protocols in progress.",
    "Men with erectile dysfunction and prostate cancer appear to have better disease specific health related quality of life than those with erectile dysfunction and no history of prostate cancer. This finding has important ramifications for clinicians when counseling patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer and also when treating patients who present with erectile dysfunction of various etiologies.",
    "The exstrophy-epispadias complex appears to occur more frequently in children conceived by in vitro fertilization.",
    "Nurses must recognize characteristics and factors related to fatigue in patients and develop strategies to help patients cope with their restricted ability in daily life.",
    "Non-uremic hepatitis C virus infected patients appear to have more active and progressive liver disease than hepatitis C virus infected patients on hemodialysis. Regular follow-up of uremic patients, associated with earlier detection of hepatitis C virus infection, so as suggested uremia-associated impaired immunoreactivity and increased levels of hepatocyte growth factor described recently, might be implicated in a more favorable course of hepatitis C virus infection in uremic patients. In addition, due to the absence of normal liver histology in either group of hepatitis C virus infected patients, we propose liver biopsy to be mandatory in all these patients, provided that no contraindications exist clinically.",
    "Although our results suggested that there were some differences in self-reporting of smoking status by gender, results were quite similar between self-reports of smoking and both biochemical tests. The results obtained from this large population-based study from two New England communities lend credibility to the use of self-reports as a low-cost accurate approach to obtaining information on smoking behaviors among both men and women in large population-based health surveys.",
    "Concomitant LGBP/LC is safe and feasible without altering port placement. Combining these procedures significantly increases operative time and nearly doubles the hospital stay.",
    "Although the problem of band slippage is not likely to be completely solved, changing the technique has made it possible to decrease the rate of this complication. The height or the shape of different types of band also remain under scrutiny.",
    "The small response rate indicates the small importance of CPR in the subpopulation surveyed. The vast majority of the responders, however, showed interest in basic and advanced life support and advocated regular updates. It seems reasonable that radiological departments themselves should organize courses in order to cope with their specific situations.",
    "The patient made good progress and was well on discharge from the ICU 26 h postenvenomation.",
    "In vivo results suggest that the increases in calpain and caspase-3 activity in uremic rat hearts were primarily due to uremia and not to hypertension. In vitro data demonstrate that uremia-induced cell injury can be attenuated by calpain inhibition. Therefore, it is likely that calpain is a mediator of uremia-induced myocardial injury.",
    "To our knowledge, this is the first case of angio-oedema localised to the free gingiva. The role of stress in the acute exacerbations of oedema and bone loss is discussed along with the diagnostic pitfalls associated with this case.",
    "The extent of high grade dysplasia, regardless of how it is defined, does not predict the presence of unsuspected adenocarcinoma at oesophagectomy. There is no evidence as yet that the extent of high grade dysplasia can be used as a basis for decision making in these patients.",
    "The TNF-1031C allele is independently associated with susceptibility to BD in Caucasoid patients. Further studies will be required to determine the functional effects of this polymorphism, its influence in disease pathogenesis, and its role in other ethnic groups.",
    "Patients of HCC with type B gamma-GTP mRNA both in cancer and in non-cancerous tissue had a worse outcome, earlier recurrence, and more post-recurrence death.",
    "Thyroid disorder was not found to be associated with Crohn's disease and was not found to increase the risk for fractures. Therefore, screening for thyroid disease is not a necessary component in the management of Crohn's disease.",
    "The concentrations of propofol in salvaged blood were low, irrespective of the different infusion rates. These results demonstrate that salvaged autologous blood would not contribute to sedative or anesthetic effect.",
    "Students and tutors need to recognize symptoms of ineffective PBL groups. Our study emphasizes the need to take into account cultural issues in setting ground rules for PBL tutorials.",
    "Prior AAS use appears to be common but underrecognized among men entering inpatient substance abuse treatment, especially those with opioid dependence. AAS use may serve as a \"gateway\" to opioid abuse in some cases and may also cause morbidity in its own right.",
    "PCT levels only rose significantly during bacterial infections. In this study PCT levels>1.2 ng/ml were always evidence of bacterial infection and the cue for starting antibiotic treatment.",
    "These data suggest that there are similar outcomes and complication rates for patients treated with suprapubic and transurethral catheters versus transurethral catheter only. Transurethral catheters alone seem effective in draining all types of bladder injuries.",
    "PE frequently occurs soon after injury. The majority of PEs after trauma are found peripherally (in segmental or subsegmental vessels). Right/left pulmonary artery embolisms are likely to be found only later in a trauma patient's course. Any diagnostic study used to diagnose pulmonary embolism in trauma patients must have sufficient resolution capacity to reliably detect segmental and subsegmental clot. A diagnostic modality such as CT scanning that is insensitive to peripheral embolisms may miss a significant number of posttraumatic PEs.",
    "To assess thoracic pedicle screw placement, triggered electromyographic thresholds<6.0 mA, coupled with values 60-65% decreased from the mean of all other thresholds in a given patient, should alert the surgeon to suspect a medial pedicle wall breach.",
    "\"Satisfactory\" results were obtained in 44 patients treated with this technique. The complication rate was low and the fusion rate was high. Posterior treatment as described above produces reasonable and dependable results.",
    "A large part of the increases in S100beta protein and NSE during CPB and SCP is not attributed to neuronal damage, but to contamination with the blood from the surgical field. To determine whether these markers are useful to predict neurologic complications, it will be necessary to exclude contamination from the surgical field as observed in the present study.",
    "The use of a short-acting anesthetic drug, appropriate intraoperative extubation criteria, epidural analgesia, and postoperative noninvasive ventilation make early extubation of lung-transplanted patients possible and effective.",
    "Despite a tendency towards favorable results in culture-positive corneal ulcers, the influence of the detection of the organism on their outcome has not been proved. The role of the initial broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy remains important.",
    "Among men in the United States, prostate cancer screening is more common than colorectal cancer screening. Physicians should ensure that men who choose to be screened for cancer are aware of the known mortality benefit of colorectal cancer screening and the uncertain benefits of screening for prostate cancer.",
    "Previous pregnancy is associated with increased likelihood to use hormonal methods; however, a significant proportion of adolescents use noneffective methods and, thus, are at risk for repeat teenage pregnancies.",
    "The outcome in the elderly requiring dialysis due to ARF post-cardiac surgery is comparable with the outcome in a younger population. No significant difference was found in severity of disease between the elderly and the younger. Variables predicting mortality in the elderly are the presence of MOF, mechanical ventilation and hypotension 24 h before starting RRT. These findings indicate that at the time the nephrologist is called for an elderly patient requiring dialysis due to ARF following cardiac surgery, age per se is not a reason to withhold RRT.",
    "This paper demonstrates that stigmatizing opinions towards emergency medicine exist and that these negative opinions may be widely held by hospital staff.",
    "Deep shave biopsy is preferable to superficial shave or punch biopsy for thin and intermediate depth (<2 mm) melanomas when an initial sample is taken for diagnosis instead of complete excision. We found that a group of predominantly experienced dermatologists accurately assessed the depth of invasive melanoma by use of a variety of initial biopsy types.",
    "No statistically significant differences were seen with regard to seasonal or monthly occurrence of acute torsion. However, the \"cold\" weather trend identified is consistent with those of larger international studies. It is possible that our regional monthly temperatures do not vary enough to demonstrate whether cold weather influences the incidence of torsion. To our knowledge, this is the only reported series regarding a seasonal predilection for torsion in the United States. A multi-institutional, prospective study representing all regions within the United States is needed to establish the significance of season and climate on testicular torsion.",
    "Although prescribing has increased, many patients who may benefit from lipid lowering drugs either do not receive it or are undertreated, possibly because of lack of awareness of the relative potency of the different statins. Patients with angina and the elderly are less likely to receive treatment that may prevent a coronary event.",
    "It is concluded that a combination of clinical assessment with SPECT or pwMRI is helpful in the preoperative selection of patients for shunting procedures with suspected NPH syndrome. This combination is a minimal invasive and objective test modality that is superior to STT alone. Further studies are necessary for a comparison of the described imaging techniques with different diagnostic tests in this difficult field of cerebral disease.",
    "Taking triplicate readings on two visits, possibly separated by just a few days, could be a minimal strategy for assessing adequately the mean BP and the prevalence of hypertension at the population level. A sound strategy is important for assessing reliably the burden of hypertension in populations.",
    "We hypothesize that this anatomic anomaly may also constitute a possible unrecognized mechanism in which shoulder pain is generated. Further studies focused at various races and the presence of this peculiarity are now needed to confirm our findings. In addition, unexplained chronic shoulder pain may be explored with vascular studies aimed at identifying the course of the suprascapular artery.",
    "The results provide strong evidence that losartan may play a role in preventing cerebral edema, and that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in postischemic cerebrovascular events.",
    "We found no statistically significant difference in AF incidence after CABG and OPCABG. Different trends were noticed in the timing of occurrence of AF in these two groups.",
    "The lack of correlation between the levels of lipid parameters and B vitamins in serum indicates that these may be independent, additional risk factors for atherosclerosis. Higher vitamin B6 deficiency in dialysis patients is probably caused by low intake combined with the increased requirements of uremic patients. Permanent monitoring of B vitamins in serum is necessary in patients with elevated risk of atherosclerosis, as well as long-term education, careful diet planning and supplementation.",
    "The YR of echocardiography was significant when clinical probability of IE was intermediate-to-high, and low, with marginal clinical utility, when clinical probability was low. Strict pretest assessment of disease probability may lead to more effective utilization of echocardiography in this population.",
    "Unstable angina in patients with left main coronary artery disease acts as a high risk factor for cardiac events, emergency surgery being recommended in these cases.",
    "The high value of the serum level/dosage ratio that was found makes it advisable to monitor the concentrations of phenobarbital in serum in treatment associated with ticlopidine or nifedipine, especially when adjusting the dosage, beginning or ending treatment with these drugs.",
    "Seriously ill hospitalized patients desire to discuss end-of-life issues with their physicians but their preferred role in decision making is variable and difficult to predict.",
    "Based on our observations, some of the so-called 'eruptive syringoma' may represent a hyperplastic response of the eccrine duct to an inflammatory reaction rather than a true adnexal neoplasm. We proposed the term 'syringomatous dermatitis' for such cases.",
    "For studies of patients with low back problems, the general SF-36 may be a sufficient measure of health status and patient function, without the need for additional condition-specific instruments. Pain scales appear to be the most responsive measures in patients with low back pain.",
    "We were unable to confirm the hypothesis that noncompliance with treatment is more prevalent in patients with secondary failure. Other variables, like comorbidity and disease-related factors seem to play a more important role in switching to insulin therapy.",
    "EMA and tTGA have similar sensitivity and specificity at the time of diagnosis of celiac disease. Positive tTGA in 28% of patients that adhered strictly to the GFD and whose EMA were negative suggest that tTGA may be helpful in detecting minor dietary transgressions and should be further evaluated.",
    "Mucosal pCO2 measurement of the gastric tube can be used as an early indicator of a complicated postoperative course predicting anastomotic leakage of the esophagogastrostomy.",
    "Infections and device durability limit the chronic use of the HeartMate device, but device failures are decreasing. Novacor has fewer problems with infection and durability, and the new Vascutek conduit will reduce, but not eliminate, strokes.",
    "Vacuum-assisted venous drainage at -40 mm Hg does not statistically reduce the ability of the CPB circuit to remove gaseous microemboli at lower pump rates. High levels of vacuum and increased pump flow rates should be avoided. Air should not be introduced into the venous line.",
    "Our study showed no preference for warm or tepid cardioplegia in terms of myocardial protection, either for clinical or biological data.",
    "Neural reorganization plays a role in vein-graft failure, possibly through the local release of mitogens; the prevention of this reorganization contributes to the inhibitory effect of the external stent on neointima formation.",
    "Endometriosis patients who were treated with norethindrone acetate following Lupron-Depot had significantly less breakthrough bleeding than those given norethindrone acetate alone, and the incidence was comparable to Lupron-Depot alone.",
    "An effect of HIV infection was only observed on one malarial antigenic determinant, suggesting that the increased susceptibility to malaria among HIV-infected pregnant women may not be explained on the basis of their reduced antibody response to malaria antigens.",
    "This study highlights that the dynamic ECG changes which occur between admission and discharge in non-ST elevation ACS patients allows further risk stratification in determining the likelihood of 6-month death and/or re(MI).",
    "Dutch cardiologists' genetic knowledge and clinical genetic practice levels are insufficient. As a result, clinical genetic care for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is poor. Improvements proposed include advancement of knowledge (education, professional guidelines) and structural measures (working relationships, multidisciplinary outpatient clinics). Collaboration of cardiologists and clinical geneticists is urgently needed to optimise cardiogenetic patient care.",
    "These results suggest that ultrasonography may be a useful adjunct to safe subarachnoid anaesthesia.",
    "Routine articulation of study models for all orthodontic patients is not supported by the results of this study. Articulation of the study models did not affect the treatment planning decisions in a meaningful manner. Further work with selected samples is required to determine if articulation is helpful for specific malocclusions.",
    "Balanced medial and lateral wall decompression combined with orbital fat removal provides an effective reduction in proptosis and reduces the incidence of postoperative permanent diplopia when compared with 3-wall decompression. This technique may eliminate the need for orbital floor excision.",
    "Despite deficiencies in their knowledge about the genetic aspects of breast cancer, many nongeneticist physicians have discussed testing and some have ordered testing.",
    "Age of the children at the time of elective cardiac surgery or catheter intervention did not influence the course of psychological distress of their parents, nor the styles of coping used by the parents. Future research should investigate in what way the age at which these cardiac procedures are performed influences the emotional and cognitive development of the children.",
    "Patients with CPB times more than 90 minutes showed more pronounced kidney damage than patients with CPB times less than 70 minutes as assessed by sensitive kidney-specific proteins. Whether patients with preexisting renal dysfunction undergoing prolonged CPB times would profit from renal protection strategies needs to be elucidated.",
    "There was no difference between Perfadex and EC in clinical lung preservation. This may reflect the difference between controlled laboratory environment and the real world of brain death lung injury. Further studies are required to investigate the impact of Perfadex in the long-term outcome of lung transplantation.",
    "The increased risk of premature death associated with ipratropium is of concern and necessitates further evaluation, e.g., in a randomised study.",
    "Frozen sperm pellets are not acceptable as a daily-use quality control material for semen analysis when using a computer assisted semen analyzer.",
    "The routine practice of chest roentgenogram after thoracentesis does not seem to be warranted and should be individualized. The performance of thoracentesis by physicians in training period, with procedure protocolization, minimizes the risk of pneumothorax.",
    "In unselected cases of ground-glass opacity evaluated at a tertiary institution, atypical infection and chronic infiltrative interstitial disease accounted for 59% of diagnoses. Distribution at a lobular level did not differentiate underlying causes.",
    "The quality of the work environment and of social relations affect sickness absence over an extended period of follow up. This study supports the hypothesis of independent, not interactive effects.",
    "In patients that on the basis of ultrasound examination can benefit from CE, information on intracranial arteries is necessary. Moreover, complete occlusion cannot be detected with certainty only by ultrasound examination.",
    "Survival rates following the initiation of HAART are dramatically improved among patients starting with CD4 counts<200 x 106 cells/l once adjusted for conservative estimates of physician experience and adherence. Our results indicate that the current emphasis of therapeutic guidelines on initiating therapy at CD4 cell counts above 200 x 106 cells/l should be re-examined.",
    "Patients with gallstones, suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones and a normal cholangiogram need not have a prophylactic sphincterotomy since there is no reduction in recurrent biliary problems and this potentially increases the morbidity.",
    "Although initial impressions suggest the RMI is a useful measure of lower limb amputee mobility, further analysis shows it is not appropriate for all amputees, with a number of limitations of its psychometric properties. Its use is not recommended in this population.",

    "Most of the women who had had an induced abortion with reported complications did, however, carry a subsequent pregnancy to term with no more complications than other women of similar parity and age.",
    "No significant difference was found in the incidence of cognitive dysfunction 3 months after either general or regional anaesthesia in elderly patients. Thus, there seems to be no causative relationship between general anaesthesia and long-term POCD. Regional anaesthesia may decrease mortality and the incidence of POCD early after surgery.",
    "During 3 months on our hospital medicine service, almost all of the patients admitted for diagnostic evaluation had clinical problems for which evidence is available to guide our estimates of pretest probability. If confirmed by others, these data suggest that clinicians' pretest probabilities could become evidence based.",
    "Nodal metastases were found in 24% of patients with detectable vessels at color Doppler examination. Subjective analysis of vessel density correlated>50%, myometrial invasion, but spectral Doppler analysis was not predictive of surgical stage, tumor grade, myometrial invasion, or lymph node metastases. These results do not support the use of preoperative intratumoral blood flow analysis as a clinical test in evaluating tumor characteristics or in predicting lymph node metastases.",
    "There is no universal standard for FFP use following major hepatic resection for colorectal metastasis. Our criterion of a prothrombin time of 16-18 seconds is conservative but results only rarely in reoperation for bleeding. Prospective evaluation of a higher threshold for FFP administration, such as an International Normal Ratio of 2.0, should be performed to better define the guidelines for FFP use in patients undergoing major hepatectomy who have normal underlying hepatic parenchyma.",
    "A low caesarean rate is possible (21% beech and 6% cephalic). Neonatal morbidity was equal in the two populations. Admission to neonatal intensive care was significantly more frequent for caesarean section than for vaginal delivery in the cephalic group and equal in the breech group. This study justifies our obstetrical policy and the realisation of a trial in several centres similar in terms of perinatal management.",
    "This is the first study to show that by modifying existing PE lessons, significant improvements in FMS mastery can be gained without adversely affecting children's MVPA and VPA. To increase PA levels, we recommend increasing the number of PE lessons per week.",
    "Motor impairment in the paretic upper limb and balance dysfunction should be addressed in treatments working toward independent ambulation.",
    "Renewed emphasis on nonprice competition and retail strategies, and the service mimicking and one-upmanship that result, suggest that a new medical arms race is emerging. However, there are important differences between the medical arms race today and the one that occurred in the 1970s and early 1980s: the hospital market is more concentrated and price competition remains relatively important. The development of a new medical arms race has significant research and policy implications.",
    "Veterans Health Administration patients with mental illness were marginally less likely than those without mental illness to receive diagnostic angiography, and no less likely to receive revascularization or medications of known benefit after acute myocardial infarction. Mortality at one year may have been higher, although this finding did not reach statistical significance. These findings are consistent with other studies showing reduced health care disparities in the VA for other vulnerable groups, and suggest that an integrated health care system with few financial barriers to health care access may attenuate some health care disparities. Further work should address how health care organizational features might narrow disparities in health care for vulnerable groups.",
    "In contrast to previous studies that fail to control for regional variations in health outcomes, we find little support for the contention that exposure to income inequality is detrimental to either individual or population health.",
    "Chronic hepatitis C acquired in childhood is a progressive, slow-moving, fibrotic disease. Fibrosis progression inferred on the basis of linear mathematical models should be critically evaluated in the clinical practice.",
    "These studies provide evidence for the existence of a maintained sub-sarcolemmal elevation of [Na] in ventricular myocardium; however, this fuzzy-space [Na]did not change immediately after the activation of Na influx via voltage-gated Na channels or throughout the contractile cycle.",
    "Clinicians should consider the prognostic importance of LVH when assessing risk in patients with CAD. Because LVH is more common among black and women patients with CAD, it partially accounts for racial and gender differences in survival.",
    "Amino acid tablets are an effective and relatively popular protein substitute in older children, teenagers, and adults with PKU.",
    "The current study shows that GPs working solo have divergent views of group practice. However, they clearly perceive advantages to this type of association (e.g. better quality of life and continuity of care). This study also confirms the high level of stress and tiredness felt by GPs and especially senior practitioners.",
    "The results support a positive effect of the education strategy on prescribing behaviour in the intervention group for most outcomes measured. The effect seen is statistically significant, sustained and is in addition to any effect of the other pharmaceutical educational initiatives already undertaken by the IPA.",
    "We conclude that RSV is one of the causative agents for TH.",
    "The results support the notion that the increasing prevalence of allergic respiratory disease is caused by a cohort effect. Thus, changes in lifestyle or environmental factors that occurred around or after 1960 may have contributed to this increase.",
    "Given the central role of IL-5-driven eosinophilia in progression from mild atopy to severe disease, these findings provide a plausible mechanism for the AEDS-promoting effects of staphylococcal SAg. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B may also have a similar role in atopic respiratory disease.",
    "These findings identify high plasma oxidized LDL/total cholesterol ratio as a possible indicator of increased risk for AMI.",
    "The present study showed that pentoxifylline plus steroid treatment has no beneficial effects on the treatment of acute rheumatic carditis when compared with steroid alone.",
    "Fast CT imaging of a moving tumor can result in poor representation of the time-averaged position and shape of the tumor. PET imaging can provide a more accurate representation of the 3D volume encompassing motion of model tumors and has potential to provide patient-specific motion volumes for an individualized ITV.",
    "Planning target volumes (PTVs) derived from a single slow CT scan plus a 5-mm margin covered the \"optimal\" PTVs generated from six scans. Although these \"slow PTVs\" were larger, the increase in V(20) (the volume of lung tissue receiving a dose>or = 20 Gy) was limited. This indicates that only two CT scans, i.e., a full rapid scan of the entire thorax and a limited slow scan, are necessary for treatment planning in peripheral lung cancers.",
    "Fracture toughness of a composite cannot be simply extrapolated from microhardness.",
    "It can be questioned whether trust is a sensitive patient reported outcome of quality of communication in highly vulnerable patients.",
    "Implementation of ICAS programmes often requires behavioural change. Cultural dimensions appear to be key factors affecting perceptions and values among healthcare workers, which in turn are critical for compliance and uptake. Customizing ICAS initiatives to reflect the local cultural background may improve their chances of success.",
    "In the absence of high-dose PPI, especially in patients at very high risk (eg, active bleeding), routine second-look endoscopy appears effective in these selected patients with PUB. However, the generalizability of these results to the era of high-dose PPI and otherwise unselected patients with high-risk stigmata is unclear.",
    "In line with published reviews of conventional multivariable analysis versus propensity score matching, Cox regressions on matched and unmatched samples produced similar estimates of treatment effects for non-leisure activity, but the estimates from matched regressions were usually smaller.",
    "Hemopericardium per se may be overly sensitive for diagnosing cardiac or great vessel injuries after chest trauma. Some stable blunt or penetrating trauma patients without continuing intrapericardial bleeding had nontherapeutic sternotomies, suggesting that this intervention could be avoided in selected cases.",
    "Frailty index is an important predictive variable in emergency general surgery patients older than 60 years. The modified frailty index can be used to evaluate risk of both morbidity and mortality in these patients. Frailty index will be a valuable preoperative risk assessment tool for the acute care surgeon.",
    "Despite population differences, ABGs at admission in Canadian patients with blunt trauma accurately reflect mortality in a similar manner to the previously published literature. Survival curves with lactate and BD values at arrival should be available to all clinicians within their individual trauma centers for both acute care and quality assurance.",
    "Among patients subjected to MT, those who receive relatively higher quantities of RBCs are both more likely to receive a lower plasma:RBC and are more likely to die. Any analysis concerning transfusion ratios should take the potential confounding of this heterogeneity among MT patients into account.",
    "The NISS and TMPM-ICD-9 are both superior predictors of mortality as compared with the ISS. The immediate adoption of NISS for evaluating trauma outcomes using trauma registry data is recommended. The TMPM-ICD-9 may be an even better measure of human injury, and its use in administrative or nonregistry data is suggested. Further research on its attributes is recommended because it has the potential to become the basis for benchmarking trauma outcomes.",
    "Our study has shown that the RCP suggestion for R status has no impact on the prognosis of PDAC. In contrast, our data confirmed the UICC R classification of RM as well as N category, grading, and lymph node ratio as significant prognostic factors.",
    "Our finding that elevated piperacillin MICs are associated with higher mortality in children supports the recent CLSI recommendation to lower the breakpoint of piperacillin against P. aeruginosa to ≤16 µg/mL. Alternate therapeutic choices should be considered when piperacillin MICs against P. aeruginosa are ≥32 µg/mL.",
    "In our study of patients with prophylactic ICD, one-third of them have improved their LVEF after a 2 year follow-up. Despite an optimal medical therapy at the time of implantation, we were able to further improve the maximal treatment doses after implantation. This study highlights the issue of what should be considered as 'optimal' therapy and the possibility of improvement of LVEF related to a real optimized treatment before implantation.",
    "The prognosis of patients with liver metastases from GTN has improved. Outcome may be best in those patients presenting within 2.8 years of the causative pregnancy and without very large volumes of disease.",
    "Liver biopsy remains the gold standard to assess the extent of hepatic fibrosis in patients with CHC.",
    "Mast cells positive for cluster of differentiation 117 protein could play a role in cholesteatoma formation. Further investigation of the role of these mast cells in cholesteatoma may suggest new ways of addressing this disorder, and may enable the development of targeted treatments.",
    "Lateral acetabular oedema-like marrow signal is a useful sign (100% PPV) in the MR diagnosis of a labral tear, if one is clinically suspected. The other findings (ganglia, dysplastic femoral bumps, synovial herniation pits and geodes) were not statistically significant. Further studies are required to evaluate these.",
    "Interventions reduced inappropriate practice but did not eliminate it completely. Compliance issues may be managed in the future via the introduction of electronic request linked to decision support.",
    "During the influenza season, almost one third of critical patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection had influenza, and in 48.4%, the influenza was unsuspected. Lower respiratory samples from adult ICUs should be systematically screened for influenza during seasonal epidemics.",
    "The present study showed that the severity of inferior rectus muscle displacement is the most important independent predictive radiologic factor in the treatment decision-making process for pure BOFs. This systematic computed tomographic assessment is a valuable tool for a better understanding of BOF management overall. Further studies are needed to establish its clinical relevance.",
    "The PET/CT strategy is potentially cost-effective for management of NSCLC in China. Patients with nodal-positive CT results are not suggested to be excluded from further PET/CT. Furthermore, maintaining high specificity of PET in clinical scenarios is crucial. Prospective trials are warranted to transfer these results into policy making.",
    "There is poor physician compliance with guidelines for IVC filter placement. Most filter indications meeting SIR guidelines are for patients classified as \"falls risks,\" failures of anticoagulation, patients with limited cardiopulmonary reserve and patients non compliant with anticoagulation medications. This single-center study suggests a need for harmonization of current guidelines espoused by professional societies.",
    "Results suggest that working conditions including high levels of control may affect how individuals cope with problems and that workplace characteristics may affect behaviour in the non-work domain.",
    "There is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that patients would benefit from routinely applying a tourniquet. The use of a tourniquet did not show any advantage to arthroscopic procedures.",
    "Circulating autoantibodies to ABCC3 transporter may be a potential biomarker that can be added to a panel of existing biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer although the gender differences should be taken into account.",
    "We consider that tinnitus interferes with sound localization ability and that interference is worse for sound originating from the same side as the tinnitus. Age is a worsening factor in sound localization ability.",
    "Beta blockers, a proven life-saving therapy in the setting of chronic systolic HF, were found to be less frequently prescribed before discharge in the presence of de novo AHF with accompanying COPD.",
    "The results suggest that pseudodementia should be considered during the design of studies using ADASCog. Because the cognitive subscale can't accurately differentiate between AK and pseudodementia additional measures like BDI should be administered.",
    "More sleep-disordered breathing events were recorded in winter than in other seasons. Cosinor analysis uncovered a significant seasonal pattern in the AHI of different patients undergoing polysomnography, independent of sex, age, BMI, neck circumference, and relative air humidity. This finding suggests that obstructive sleep apnea severity may be associated with other seasonal epidemiologic phenomena.",
    "We found no evidence that CMS nonpayment policy resulted in overtesting to screen for and document a diagnosis of urinary tract infection as present on admission.",
    "Our data show that BCG vaccination may be effective in protecting children against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. To restrict use of IFN-γ release assays to children with positive skin tests risks underestimating latent infection.",
    "The calculation of buffer reactions in a hypothetical acidic urine predicted a negligible effect on urine pH on loss of CO(2) by air exposure, which was empirically proven by the experimental study. Therefore, exposure of urine to air does not substantially alter the results of diagnostic tests for urine acidification, and urine collection under oil is not necessary.",
    "For diagnosis of DESD, EUSP measurement is inaccurate and cannot replace combined pelvic floor EMG and VCUR.",
    "Chronically hyperactive somatotropic axis remains as an independent and determining factor in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, as it is more associated with this condition than hypertension in a largely admixed population with a high degree of African ancestry.",
    "Against widely held opinion, our exploratory analysis showed that women with gestational hypertension or mild pre-eclampsia at term who have an unfavourable cervix benefited more from labour induction than other women.",
    "Important predispositions increase the risk of PTSD following sexual assault as much as they do following accidents, disaster, and unexpected death of someone close. Research on other predispositions and alternative classifications of event severity would be illuminating.",
    "A period of 6 months seems to be sufficient to treat extrapulmonary tuberculosis (except for neuromeningeal localization).",
    "The high reliability of PFJRF measurements on both dominant and non-dominant legs of healthy subjects suggests that the PFJRF measurement would not be influenced by the leg predomination during single leg squatting.",
    "Irrespective of the measure used, comorbidity is an independent risk factor for adverse outcome after colorectal surgery. However, the importance of comorbidity in risk-adjustment models is limited. Probably the work and costs of data collection for auditing can be reduced, without compromising risk-adjustment.",
    "No clear survival benefit with the use of the EXIT to ECMO procedure was demonstrated in this updated report of our high-risk CDH population. The general application of EXIT to ECMO for CDH is not supported by our results.",
    "Increased amounts of liver herniation in fetuses with isolated left-sided CDH are associated with higher rates of mortality or the need for ECMO support. Quantification of liver herniation (a continuous variable) is superior to overall liver herniation as a dichotomous variable (liver-up vs liver-down) in the prediction of perinatal morbidity and mortality.",
    "Surgery may play a role in responding patients. In patients with progressive disease, the role of surgery is more difficult to distinguish in this retrospective analysis since PFS is short. Which patients benefit and whether this improves long-term outcome should be established in a multicentric randomized trial.",
    "In our experience, ASN were not associated with metastatic potential. Surgical staging procedures are not justified and careful clinical surveillance is adequate.",
    "Our data suggest that children with low grade hydronephrosis and otherwise normal kidneys and bladder do not benefit from voiding cystourethrographic screening. Interestingly high grade hydronephrosis appears to carry a threefold greater risk of urinary tract infection compared to low grade hydronephrosis.",
    "A low level of physical activity was associated with a 2 to 3 times greater likelihood of lower urinary tract symptoms. Smoking may contribute to the development of lower urinary tract symptoms in women but not in men. Clinicians should continue to promote physical activity and smoking cessation, noting the additional potential benefits of the prevention of lower urinary tract symptoms, particularly for women.",
    "All referred patients should continue to have their pathology centrally reviewed. This practice will help facilitate optimal prostate cancer management and improve quality of care. While these findings are dated given pathologic practice change, such changes do not necessarily equate with disparity elimination or reduction; conclusions can only be drawn with a more recent audit to see if such disparities still exist.",
    "Our data suggest that 20 cases of HAL PDD are required to achieve a good interobserver agreement between inexperienced and experienced operator, and excellent agreement is achieved after 30 cases. The false positive rate of inexperienced operators was comparable to the experts and showed a gradual decrease.",
    "The UI rates in our cohort of active surveillance patients who move on to active treatment are similar to patients who undergo treatment immediately after prostate cancer is diagnosed as quoted in the literature.  This suggests that active surveillance, as an initial mode of therapy, does not increase the risk of UI if active treatment occurs at a later date.",
    "FDG uptake by the primary lesion was significantly associated with several prognostic variables, but it was not an independent prognostic factor.",
    "STEMI patients admitted during OH were disadvantaged with respect to use and speed of delivery of primary PCI but not fibrinolytic therapy. Hospitals providing primary PCI during OH should aim to deliver it in a timely manner throughout the day.",
    "In summary, an increased number of rescuers improves the outcomes of OHCAs. However, this beneficial effect is absent in OHCAs that occur at home.",
    "These data suggest an association between anaesthetic technique and cancer outcome in MM patients after lymph-node dissection. Prospective controlled trials on this topic are warranted.",
    "Mesenteric panniculitis is often associated with an underlying malignancy. In most cases, malignancy is diagnosed before mesenteric panniculitis. Lymph node size (>12 mm) and the absence of the fat ring sign were identified as predictors of subsequent diagnosis of malignancy in patients with mesenteric panniculitis. Identification of mesenteric panniculitis on imaging should prompt an awareness for possible malignancy in these patients.",
    "The best torsional resistances were found in the capitellar starting group along with increased pin diameter. The capitellar starting point enables the surgeon to engage sufficient bone of the distal fragment and maximizes pin separation at the fracture site. In our anatomically reduced fracture model, the addition of a third pin provided no biomechanical advantage.",
    "We speculate that distraction-based, growth-friendly instrumentations are not risk-free for spinal health and motion, even when the instrumentation is not primarily on the spine.",
    "In this study patients with pelvic fractures and thoracic trauma benefited positively from an earlier definitive pelvic fracture stabilization with respect to a shorter time of ventilation and stay in the intensive care unit due to a lower need for red cell concentrates.",
    "Low plasma citrulline levels in patients correlate well with intestinal dysfunction.",
    "The success of ETV in our series could have been predicted by ETVSS. Predictability could help establish stricter surgical selection criteria, thereby obtaining higher success rates, as well as preparing the patients and their families for expected outcomes.",

    "LVHR in the elderly with incisional hernias have longer LOS and have a higher need for post-discharge nursing care unlike their counterparts with primary hernias. Identifying this cohort of patients early on helps the health-care providers to optimize the outcomes.",
    "In a population with only passive leads, the Fidelis lead exhibited an impaired long-term survival, but performance was better than in previous studies in which>90% of leads were active models.",
    "For medical text classification, appropriate active learning algorithms can yield performance comparable to that of passive learning with considerably smaller training sets. In particular, our results suggest that DIV performs better on data with higher diversity and DIST on data with lower uncertainty.",
    "There is not increased risk for chest compression and entubation for infants ≥ 35 gestation weeks without antenatally identified risk factors born with elective CS either under regional or general anesthesia and only 4.2% of the babies needed bag-mask ventilation, so a health care personel who knows basic NRP may be sufficient in the clinics where it is easy to achieve an advanced skilled health care personel when needed.",
    "Despite the fact that ultrasound is the method of choice for fetal screening, MRI can add up significantly to the diagnosis and management of congenital abnormalities and the indications for MRI continue to increase as new sequences and shorter acquisition times evolve.",
    "Anemia during the first trimester is significantly and independently associated with an increased risk for subsequent PTD.",
    "The experienced and inexperienced groups were  similar in their overall MH performance; the only difference was the observation of the highest PIF in the results from the experienced group.",
    "No strong association (OR of 2 or more) was found between the male gender and major organ involvement, except for vascular lesions.",
    "Overall, ethnic minority concentration was associated with a mixture of both advantages and disadvantages in the provision of food outlets and physical activity facilities. These issues might contribute to ethnic differences in food choices and engagement in physical activity.",
    "Certain PCMH practice systems were related to lower costs, but these effects are small compared with total costs. Further research about how these and other PCMH domains affect costs over time is needed.",
    "PMN functional impairment in AD patients could represent an additional cause of skin infections, coupled with other known defects in the innate immune system. The increased MFI of adhesion molecules and TLRs is rather a consequence of the increased skin barrier permeability to bacterial molecules capable of stimulating immunological reactions.",
    "Ultrasound surveillance is unlikely to benefit patients with TM in the absence of other risk factors. In the presence of additional risk factors (previous testicular cancer, a history of maldescent or testicular atrophy) patients are likely to be under surveillance; nonetheless monthly self-examination should be encouraged, and open access to ultrasound and formal annual surveillance should be offered.",
    "An increased frequency of dry eye disease was found to occur in patients with migraine, which might suggest that migraine headaches are related to dry eye disease. Some migraine attacks may be aggravated in the presence of dry eye syndrome.",
    "Hip fractures, minor pelvic fractures, femur fractures, and minor thoracic wall injuries are associated with increased mortality. Comparative outcome analysis of a population with a reference database that differs in case-mix with respect to these injuries should be interpreted cautiously.",
    "This meta-analysis emphasized that the two operations could be performed during the same session without any negative oncologic results. The resolution during the same session of bladder outlet obstruction will improve the patients' quality of life and performing the procedures in the same session sparing the patients from a further anesthesiological maneuvers and the need for a further hospitalization for the surgical resolution of the prostatic obstruction.",
    "Our results showed that only a modest improvement in reliability of the surgical long case is achieved through the introduction of an additional examiner. Although the reliability of global scoring and the itemised marking template was comparable, the latter may provide opportunities for individualised feedback to examinees.",
    "Within the current sample, general psychiatric labels did not appear to distinguish themselves from each other on measures of attitude and social distance but did so when compared to a relatively more specific term. Future research should examine the underlying mechanism driving this finding, with the ultimate goal of reducing the stigma faced by those with mental disorders.",
    "In the present experimental study, we were unable to demonstrate any clinically relevant modulating effect of terbutaline on fluid extravasation during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass.",
    "No association was evident between caffeine intake and UI in middle-aged and older Japanese adults. Further studies are required to confirm the effect of caffeine in the prevention of UI.",
    "This data-driven study showed that contrary to anecdotal belief breaking bad news was not intolerable to a cohort of native Nigerian-African patients in a neurosurgical practice.",
    "Initiating treatment with 60 mg/day DLX was not associated with poorer tolerability in this study. Physicians may be guided by their clinical experience to carefully consider the individual benefit/risk ratio and TEAE susceptibility when deciding to start treatment with a higher or a lower dose of DLX.",
    "School-based YHCs are becoming more common as a means of responding to adolescent health needs. Despite experiencing numerous health challenges, male youth continue to underutilize these services. Multisectoral health promotion strategies are needed, especially in higher grades, to help create an environment that encourages utilization of YHCs.",
    "Among prepubescent children, the influence of biological maturity on gender differences in PA may be a function of how maturity status is determined. The most physically active prepubescent children were those who were on time according to APHV.",
    "Amblyopia or having recovered amblyopia does not functionally impact on childhood motor development, teenage self-esteem or adult socioeconomic status within this cohort. The wide range of visual deficits and adaptations that are known to occur in amblyopic vision do not translate into important 'real life' outcomes for the study members with amblyopia or recovered amblyopia. The age-related cumulative lifetime risk of bilateral visual impairment in amblyopia will be assessed in future studies.",
    "To further improve the responsiveness of DMPs to patients' needs, we suggest to monitor 'patient relevant outcomes' that might be based on the ICF-model. To address the needs of patients with multimorbidity, we propose a generic comprehensive model, embedded in primary care. A goal-oriented approach provides the opportunity to prioritize goals that really matter to patients.",
    "Most of the literature on the influence of rural undergraduate placements, especially short term placements, examines immediate changes. This study adds to the evidence by showing that positive effects from a rural undergraduate placement persist into the postgraduate years, although that in isolation is unlikely to result in a significant workforce effect. Further investigation is warranted into which features of the undergraduate placement result in an extended positive effect on student attitudes.",
    "A large variation in pain scores within and across conditions and gender was noted, suggesting that at the current stage: 1) isokinetic angular velocity prescription be performed on an individual patient basis; and 2) improvements in the manner pain is recorded are needed in order to reduce the variations in pain scores.",
    "These results suggest that ROTEM data do not substantially improve a model's ability to predict chest tube drainage, beyond frequently used clinical and laboratory parameters. Although several ROTEM parameters were individually associated with CTO, they did not significantly improve goodness of fit when added to statistical models comprising only clinical and routine laboratory parameters. ROTEM does not seem to improve prediction of chest tube drainage after cardiac surgery involving CPB, although its use in guiding transfusion during cardiac surgery remains to be determined.",
    "This study demonstrated that chronic recordings up to 3-months can be made from the descending tracts of the rat spinal cord with relatively small changes in signal characteristics over time and that the forelimb kinematics can be reconstructed with the recorded signals. Multi-unit recording technique may prove to be a viable alternative to single neuron recording methods for reading the information encoded by neuronal populations in the spinal cord.",
    "Increased complexity and workload may have an impact on palliative radiation treatment discrepancies. This information may help guide the necessary recommendations for process improvement for patients who require palliative radiation therapy.",
    "No medical or environmental factor predicts the hospitalization of geriatric resident. Build a process of decision should be an important factor to decreasing emergency admission.",
    "In conclusion, our results indicate that follicular flushing during oocyte retrieval does not improve the retrieved oocyte number or clinical pregnancy rate but, it significantly increases the duration of procedure.",
    "Policy-makers interested in doing more to control tobacco should be reassured that, for the most part, they have the support of smokers, with greatest support in countries with the strongest regulations. Smokers economically disadvantaged by smoking were more supportive of government policies to regulate the tobacco industry suggesting that reactance against regulation is not likely to differentially contribute to lower cessation rates in this group.",
    "Previous thyroid operation and large dominant nodule were independent risk factors for hematoma requiring surgical reexploration. Given that a quarter of hematoma occurred between 6 to 24 h after surgery, routine outpatient thyroidectomy could not be recommended.",
    "There seems to be a range of beneficial RV hypertrophy after atrial switch in which a sufficient RV-EF can be expected. A positive septal movement, probably the result of hypertrophic septal RV fibres, improves RV function and might be regarded as a beneficial contraction pattern.",
    "Hypoparathyroidism is more common (46%) in our dialysis patients as compared to hyperparathyroidism (28%). There is high prevalence of vascular (abdominal aortic) calcification (80%) in our dialysis patients.",
    "Findings contradict an earlier seminal study that Apostolics are relatively protected from HIV compared to other Christian denominations. Young Apostolic women are at increased risk of HIV infection through early marriage. The Apostolic Church is a large and growing denomination in sub-Saharan Africa and many Apostolic sects discourage medical testing and treatment in favor of faith healing. Since this can increase the risk of undiagnosed HIV infection for young married women and their infants in high prevalence areas, further study is urgently needed to confirm this emerging public health problem, particularly among orphan girls. Although empirical evidence suggests that keeping orphan girls in school can reduce HIV risk factors, further study of the religious context and the implications for prevention are needed.",
    "For Australia, and countries with a similar pattern of predominant high-intensity drinking, taxation policies that increase the price of alcohol and are very efficient at decreasing harms associated with reduced average consumption may be relatively inefficient at decreasing alcohol harms associated with high-intensity drinking.",
    "Despite higher BMI Z-scores in 2008, differences in cardiometabolic indicators between 1999 and 2008 were small and may not be clinically meaningful. Surveillance to closely monitor trends in cardiometabolic indicators in Canadian youth is needed.",
    "The method described in the paper, easily implemented in the clinical practice, combines all the advantages of in vivo procedures using the OneDosePlusTM system with the possibility of detecting intra-fraction patient movements.",
    "The results of the present study suggest that a diagnostic criterion of subjective memory complaint reduces the accuracy of MCI diagnosis, resulting in an elevated rate of false positive and false negative diagnoses. The results of this study in conjunction with recent research indicate that a criterion of subjective memory complaint should be discarded from emerging diagnostic criteria for MCI.",
    "TVES was a useful technique in confirming the diagnoses of cervical cancer and in estimating the infiltrating region. When the strain ratio of a cervical lesion was higher than 4.53, it is confidential to be diagnosed as malignant.",
    "Patients with schizophrenia in the chronic phase of the disease, but not the discordant co-twins, show a lack of increase in IQ, which is probably due to environmental (non-genetic) factors related to the disease.",
    "Even with the use of supplements, more than a one-third of children failed to meet calcium and vitamin D recommendations. Children 2-8 years old had nutritionally adequate diets regardless of supplement use. However, in children older than 8 years, dietary supplements added micronutrients to diets that would have otherwise been inadequate for magnesium, phosphorus, vitamins A, C, and E. Supplement use contributed to the potential for excess intakes of some nutrients. These findings may have implications for reformulating dietary supplements for children.",
    "Adolescents with low family wealth scored lower on stage of change, awareness, modelling, self-efficacy and environmental correlates of PA, and higher on PA barriers, which in turn resulted in lower levels of moderate-to-vigorous PA. Future interventions should target these individual and environmental constructs in order to tackle and intervene on social inequalities in PA among adolescents.",
    "Groups most at risk of repeat infection with gonorrhoea are highly predictable but are disinclined to provide detailed information on their sexual behaviour. Care pathways including targeted and intensive one-to-one risk reduction counselling, effective partner notification and offers of re-testing could deliver considerable public health benefit.",
    "ChT activity elevates in PCOS independent of obesity. Our findings support the concept of PCOS is a state of low-grade chronic inflammation where the macrophages could play the major role. Hyperandrogenism might also be related to this inflammatory state and can be a subject of further trials.",
    "The dental profession as a whole needs to acquire a deeper understanding of the global effects of superfluous antibiotic prescription. Antibiotics when judiciously used are precise life-saving drugs.",
    "We observed that emotional effects of tooth loss are also experienced among our patients with a range of emotions quite similar to those observed by previous authors from the developed world. The significant number of patients that failed to come to terms with their tooth loss indicates that the effect of tooth loss on self-esteem and self-image is not short lived as it has been assumed.",
    "A rectangular footplate design is more resistant to subsidence than a circular footplate design in an ex vivo biomechanical model. The new design had higher load to failure even in the presence of a central defect. These findings suggest that rectangular footplates may provide better subsidence resistance when used to reconstruct defects after thoracolumbar corpectomy.",
    "An informational film does not increase women's knowledge or the number of women making an informed choice about the second trimester ultrasound. Women who did not make an informed choice about the second trimester ultrasound had a lower level of education and less knowledge about second trimester ultrasound screening.",
    "When ISO 15197 was applied, Roche, HemoCue and Abbott fulfilled the criterion in this patient population, whereas Nova and Menarini did not. However, when TNO quality guideline and NACB/ADA 2011 guideline were applied only Roche fulfilled the criteria.",
    "This study showed that domestic work is a highly gendered activity as women tend to have a greater and men a smaller responsibility. Both these directions of inequality in domestic work, in combination with experiencing the couple relationship as gender-unequal, were associated with psychological distress There is a need for more research with a relational approach on inequalities in health in order to capture the power relations within couples in various settings.",
    "Mediastinal LN metastases are a significant negative prognostic factor for survival after pulmonary metastasectomy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Computed tomography and positron emission tomography based imaging, as well as preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels have poor sensitivity for detecting malignant mediastinal LN in this setting. Systematic mediastinal LND should be performed for prognostic purposes during pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal metastases.",
    "Among adults with previously treated scoliosis requiring extension to the sacro-pelvis, PSF produced radiographic fusion and clinical outcomes equivalent to APSF, whereas complication rates may be lower. PSO resulted in greater sagittal plane correction, without an increase in overall complication rates.",

    "Discontinuation of mid-CP follow-up among new sputum smear-positive cases who become sputum smear-negative after completing the intensive-phase of treatment will reduce the laboratory workload without impacting overall early detection of cases of treatment failure.",
    "Although additional research is needed to clarify the contributions of memory processes, anesthesia, and aging in delayed-onset PTSD, prudent clinicians will be cognizant of a potential correlation and screen patients appropriately.",
    "This pilot study provides insight into how clinicians use a tool for blood transfusion counselling and shows the potential to influence patients' beliefs about transfusion. Whilst the checklist has a role in standardising practice, this pilot study highlights the need for optimising its use before undertaking a fully randomised evaluation of the tool.",
    "Cases of unexplained IUGR with abnormal umbilical artery Dopplers appear to be at increased risk of preeclampsia compared to those with normal Dopplers.",
    "More left sided tumours appear to be detected in screened patients compared with symptomatic presentation, contrary to previously published work. These results may be worthy of further consideration given the ongoing debate on the optimal means of screening.",
    "• RCC arising in native kidneys of transplant patients seems to exhibit many favourable clinical, pathological and outcome features compared with those diagnosed in dialysis-only patients. Further research is needed to determine whether it is due to particular molecular pathways or to biases in relation to mode of diagnosis.",
    "Submucosal fibrosis of early gastric tumors is closely related to tumor size, location, ulceration, histologic findings, and submucosal invasion. Moreover, the greater the degree of submucosal fibrosis the longer the time taken for the ESD procedure and the higher the frequency of complications such as perforation and immediate bleeding.",
    "FMU care appears to offer important benefits for birthing women with no additional risk to the infant. Both for women with and without post-secondary education, intending to give birth in an FMU significantly increased the likelihood of a spontaneous, uncomplicated birth with good outcomes for mother and infant compared to women intending to give birth in an OU. All women should be provided with adequate information about different care models and supported in making an informed decision about the place of birth.",

    "Single-operator cholangioscopy is not associated with an increased rate of complications when compared to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The types and frequencies of overall endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography complications are similar to previously reported series.",
    "Our results support the hypothesis that during early life the fetus depends on maternal cholesterol supply because endogenous synthesis is relatively low. Therefore, maternal cholesterol can play a crucial role in fetal development.",
    "If the individual mandate is implemented nationwide, the Massachusetts' experience indicates that a near-term decrease in overall hospital productivity will occur. As such, current cost estimates of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's impact on overall health spending are potentially understated.",
    "Ambiguities and contradictions in dialogue about conscious level arise during ambulance calls for suspected and confirmed stroke. Further study is needed to identify whether these issues also arise in non-stroke calls, and which terms are best understood by the public in describing conscious level.",
    "The results of this study provide data that assist in clinical management. Gonadotropin serum levels after OCP treatment provide information for optimization of supplementation with LH in GnRH-antagonist cycles in women over age 35.",
    "MDCT may not be a primary technique for detecting CBD stones. EUS should be performed instead as an add-on test to evaluate the CBD for patients with gallstone-related disease. In particular, EUS should be routinely recommended for patients with abnormal liver enzyme levels, pancreatitis, and dilated CBD.",
    "The low PC detection rate questions the overall usefulness of PC screening in a geographical region where histological PC is not very common.",
    "Different control groups may have accounted for the different conclusions in the literature regarding the ability of PVP to relieve pain and restore function recovery. Compared with nonoperative treatment PVP relieved pain better and improved QOL. PVP did not increase the risk of new fractures.",
    "Based on our results, we conclude that more than 50% of our SDNS patients with MCD remained relapse-free 4 years post-CYC treatment. No significant difference in the response to CYC was observed between patients with or without IgM positivity.",
    "The prevalence of undernutrition in patients in Dutch rehabilitation centres is high. Almost half of the undernourished patients were overweight or obese. Therefore, it is important not only to screen for undernutrition, but also carefully to assess possible overweight/obesity in every undernourished rehabilitation patient.",
    "The unusual, possibly fortuitous association of EE and BE, two conditions differing in etiopathogenesis, clinical and pathological features, calls for a correct diagnosis to offer suitable treatment and prognosis.",
    "3D power Doppler sonography can provide new insights into placental pathophysiology. FI, which identifies the most severe cases of placental impairment, appears to be the most reliable index because of its low intraplacental variability. Further studies are needed to verify its accuracy when applied in clinical practice as a substitute for or an adjunct to umbilical artery Doppler studies.",
    "Although anxiety and depression are prevalent in patients with CRS, they do not influence the correlation between nasal symptoms and CT findings. Markers of psychiatric comorbidity do not correlate with CRS symptoms. The presence of anxiety or depression does not cloud symptom reporting in CRS and should not bias clinical decision-making.",
    "Clinical experience with the use of LUS measurement in predicting uterine rupture and managing VBAC is limited. Having a national registry to record data and review all cases of uterine rupture would accelerate the accumulation of experience on this subject.",
    "The measurement of HDL level as well as functionality plays an important role in CAD risk assessment. Those SAIs with dysfunctional HDL and without known CAD can be a high risk group requiring treatment with lipid lowering drugs to reduce future risk of CAD. Further large studies are required to explore association of dysfunctional HDL with CAD and identify additional CAD risk caused by dysfunctional HDL.",
    "Even despite precise surgical technique including pressurized irrigation, a significant amount of debris is still present after TKA. The debris consists predominantly of bone and cement particles. The presence of metal debris is limited, and contributes only 1.5% to the total amount.",
    "Tachycardia inducibility was higher in patients with syncope than in the asymptomatic group. The incidence of malignant WPW syndrome was higher in patients with syncope than in asymptomatic or symptomatic population, but the maximal rate conducted over AP was not higher and another mechanism could be also implicated in the mechanism of syncope.",
    "CHD has a more detrimental effect on physical and mental health functioning among those in more disadvantaged socioeconomic positions.",
    "Although totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy needs more cost, totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy provides shorter bowel recovery time than laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy.",
    "This study is the first attempt to apply the Six Core Outcomes to meeting the needs for mental health care among CSHCN. Estimates of unmet need for mental health care suggest that efforts can be made to improve access for CSHCN. The initial estimates generated by this study indicate that the MCHB Outcomes are important in meeting children's mental health needs and are important indicators for informing MCHB policy.",
    "Occult cancer was identified in 5% of PMs. PM with or without SLNB spared only 4 of 393 patients (1%) from undergoing ALND, whereas PM alone identified unsuspected invasive disease in 3 of 136 patients (2%). When performed, MRI accurately ruled out the presence of an invasive cancer in the prophylactic breast, suggesting that MRI can be used to select patients for PM without SLNB.",
    "Variation in the type of control subjects used and in exposure assessment in case-control studies may partially explain conflicting data regarding the association between surgery and CJD. However, there was almost complete confounding of these 2 parameters, making interpretation more difficult. Planning of future investigations must carefully consider these design elements.",
    "Despite early maternal intentions and multiple supportive interventions, 27% of children born to women with significant substance abuse problems in our area required child protection during the pre-school years. Child protection risk assessment procedures need to weigh problematic maternal drug use heavily. Intervention studies with child welfare outcomes are needed to identify the most effective harm reduction strategies and inform public debate on how we can minimize child abuse related to substance misuse.",
    "Whilst the degree of vascular invasion and poor differentiation of rectal tumours were significant risk factors for lymph node metastasis, depth of submucosal invasion was not. This has important implications for patients with superficial early rectal cancers in whom local excision is being considered.",
    "Drug products containing soy lecithin can cause severe allergic reactions in patients allergic to peanuts or soy. Physicians should be aware that adverse drug reactions can be due to both the active medical component and the excipient ingredients.",
    "Our model may not be a complete NAHI mimic. The discrepancies may ensue from anatomical and mechanical differences in the injury mechanism. Other models must be sought to further study this form of abusive eye injury.",
    "The CIT gives valuable insights into the patient's perspective of strengths and weaknesses in hospital care, which might be overlooked by the questionnaire alone. However, the CIT is probably not suited for routine use because it is very time-consuming.",
    "Adrenergic hyporesponsiveness is present in septic shock and persists for at least 5 days into recovery, resolving by days 8-10 in survivors.",
    "This data confirm that frozen section diagnosis is a reliable method for the surgical management of patients with an ovarian mass, but history of disease, Para clinical criteria and gross examination can help to surgeon to perform on appropriate operation in the areas where frozen section is not possible.",
    "This trial, although small, offers no evidence that AC chemotherapy provides additional disease control for premenopausal patients with lower-risk node-positive endocrine-responsive breast cancer who receive adequate adjuvant endocrine therapy. A large trial is needed to determine whether chemotherapy adds benefit to endocrine therapy for this population.",
    "In Brazil, the prevalence of asthma and related symptoms is quite variable and independent of SES.",
    "Tracheotomy performed in the Intensive Care Unit as a bedside procedure is safe, quick and effective. Complication rate in the group of patients in poor general condition is comparable both to the average population and to the percutaneous technique.",
    "These results suggest that TNFA -308 (G/A) polymorphism may influence the susceptibility of female gender gallbladder cancer in absence of gallstones while IL6 -174 G/C polymorphism does not seem to be playing significant role in the susceptibility to gallbladder cancer.",
    "These results show a statistically significantly higher rate of extraprostatic disease and earlier BCR in men with a high than a low PSA level even in Gleason score 6 prostate cancer. As the rate of BCR and extracapsular extension are significantly related to prostate cancer mortality, these findings further support the concept of screening using low PSA levels.",
    "These findings suggest EPA inhibits symptomatic cerebral vasospasm and cerebral infarction after SAH and also improves clinical prognosis.",
    "Even among faculty physicians at university medical centers, the notion of seafood allergy as a significant risk factor for adverse radiocontrast media reactions remains pervasive. Even if no action is taken on the basis of the answer, it seems probable that the act of inquiring about seafood allergy before radiocontrast media administration could lead patients and trainees to presume an inherent risk in patients who are seafood allergic, thus propagating the notion. Physician education with respect to seafood allergy and radiocontrast media administration is vital to halting the persistence of this misconception.",
    "These findings indicated that with the main renal artery axis deviating from the perpendicular plane of the aorta or with a smaller branching angle, this artery had a greater diameter and underwent late branching. This study suggested that the renal artery diameter and branching pattern might be determined by the mechanical fluid laws.",
    "Relief of chronic pelvic pain symptoms, or lack of response, with preoperative hormonal therapy is not an accurate predictor of presence or absence of histologically confirmed endometriosis at laparoscopy. Patients with chronic pelvic pain may benefit from laparoscopy and no judgment regarding diagnosis should be made without this evaluation.",
    "The increase in aortic neck size was much greater 2 years after EVAR versus open repair. Further research is ongoing to establish whether the dilatation is progressive after stent-graft placement.",
    "An elevated FAI appears to be a prognostic factor for a subsequent miscarriage in women with RM and is a more significant predictor of subsequent miscarriage than an advanced maternal age (>or =40 years) or a high number (>or =6) of previous miscarriages in this study.",
    "Neurotic hostility, CHD-prone personality and anti-social personality were all predictive of mortality outcomes. Further research is required to determine the precise mechanisms that contribute to these associations.",
    "We expected a recovery in median nerve conduction velocities in patients with CTS after weight loss. In the literature, even in untreated cases with CTS, spontaneous improvements in second NCS have been reported. This finding suggests that factors other than excess body weight may be influential in the higher prevalence of CTS in obese patients. A more detailed, genetic-factor-targeted investigation may prove more beneficial to clarify this issue.",
    "Well-funded, population-based tobacco-control programs can be effective in reducing smoking among students from all SES groups.",
    "These results are suggestive of a role of meat intake and NAT2 on bladder cancer risk. They support the hypothesis that among subjects with the rapid NAT2 acetylation genotype higher levels of HAAs exposure are a bladder cancer risk factor. We did not observe an effect of SULT1A1 allele variants on this cancer. The present study adds new information on the possible long-term adverse effects of diets with high meat intake.",
    "The frequency of the disease-causing mutations screened routinely among the AJ population indicated that there are rare mutations with very low frequencies. The screening policy of the disease-causing mutations should be reevaluated and mutations with a high frequency should be screened, while rare mutations with a lower frequency may be tested in partners of carriers.",
    "Failure to perform a risk assessment and to provide appropriate venous thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients is considered negligent. Clinicians looking after all hospitalized patients who are not assessing their patients' risk for VTE and/or not providing appropriate prophylaxis are at risk of being accused of negligence.",
    "Venous reflux is highly likely to occur in DVT limbs within a year follow-up period. Venous dilatation can occur in the contralateral unaffected lower limb, consistent with a systemic effect. Our results are suggestive and further studies are needed.",
    "HHD, guided by the routine duplex scan, can accurately mark SPJ with reflux. A second duplex is not required for marking prior to surgery. This will reduce the workload of the vascular laboratory.",
    "Our results indicate that treatment of HP infection by eradication regimen (triple therapy only) is not enough to prevent recurrence of ulcer in the Jordanian population. Thus, we recommend maintenance acid suppression following standard H. pylori eradication regimen to maintain remission.",
    "CPAP therapy can improve the sexual function in ED patients with OSAS.",
    "In a contemporary patient population the risk of local recurrence after lumpectomy and radiation therapy is very low. If screening MRI had been a part of annual follow-up, a total of 2570 MRIs would have been performed. Given the small tumor size at detection and the excellent survival of those who recurred, annual screening MRI would have incurred significant cost and would have been unlikely to improve overall survival.",
    "CE can be applied as a screening procedure for DBE and allows for an approximately two-thirds reduction in the need for DBE as well as enabling a choice to be made between the oral and anal route.",
    "1. Patients with STEMI and DM treated with insulin at hospital discharge have higher risk of death, probably because of more advanced DM and more severe complications, than patients treated with oral drugs or diet. 2. Elevated glucose level at hospital discharge predict one-year mortality only in patients with MI and DM treated with oral drugs or diet.",
    "PONV was reduced when the fluid deficit was replaced preoperatively.",
    "Intraoperative evaluation of anastomosis prevents early anastomotic insufficiency because intraoperative identification of leaks allows for repair during surgery. Nevertheless, a certain rate of anastomotic dehiscence occurs in every kind of colon resection. The sometimes increased rate of dehiscence in laparoscopic-assisted colon resection can be reduced by intraoperative colonoscopy.",
    "VTS at either the T3 or T4 level provides an effective treatment for PH. VTS at the T4 level is associated with a less severe form of CH. Despite the occurrence of CH, patients' quality of life is significantly improved following VTS at the T3 or T4 levels. For this reason, the T4 resection can now be used as a treatment for PH.",
    "Our results suggest that op-AES is not necessary during GLA because there is no difference in clinical and functional status that can be attributed to op-AES.",
    "Although total hospital-onset MRSA bloodstream infection rates were relatively stable during 2000-2006, CG strains were responsible for an increasing proportion of cases (from 24% to 49%), suggesting replacement of traditional hospital-associated strains. For most risk factors and outcomes, patients infected with CG and HG strains were similar, suggesting that, thus far, CG strains are behaving like their traditional hospital-associated counterparts.",
    "In older adults, MPH appears to improve certain aspects of EF, mobility, and gait stability. Although additional studies are required to assess clinical utility and efficacy, the present findings suggest that methylphenidate and other drugs that are designed to enhance attention may have a role as a therapeutic option for reducing fall risk in older adults.",
    "Men's violence against women in intimate relationships is commonly occurring in rural Vietnam. There is an obvious need of preventive and treatment activities. Our findings point at that pure psychological abuse is different from physical/sexual violence in terms of differing characteristics of the perpetrators and it might be that also different strategies are needed to reduce and prevent this violence.",
    "The morbidity reported by patients suffering from chronic, untreated tonsillitis decreases with time. Tonsillectomy produces significantly greater reductions in morbidity than time alone.",
    "Female hormone replacement therapy has no discernable effect upon nasal physiology and should not be considered a cause of rhinitic symptoms.",
    "The AUC of ROC curves within various age subgroups tends to be stable; therefore, we are led to believe that a PSA or PSAV cutoff for safely commending discontinuation of PCa screening is not apparent from these data.",
    "The volume of calf muscle available for promoting venous return alone may not be an accurate indicator of muscle functioning capability."
